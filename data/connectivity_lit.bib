Abstract = {{This research analyses the impact of climate change and surface mining
   activities on the hydrologic connectivity of surficial (soil and
   geological) layers located in a watershed in the Athabasca Oil Sands
   Region. Surface water and groundwater flow are simulated for the period
   2014-2080 under four climate scenarios: median (M), double precipitation
   (DP), no change in precipitation (NP), and double temperature (DT) and
   with the assumption of no change in the extent of mine activities after
   2013. The results demonstrate that the annual growing season duration is
   longer and snowmelt happens earlier in the year 2080. During the growing
   season, the daily proportion of connected hydrologic units (DPCUs)
   remains approximately the same in the future under the different climate
   scenarios. It appears that around 68\% of watershed area, mostly in
   western and central eastern portions, will be frequently connected
   (annual proportion of connected days {[}APCD] >= 20\%) in the future.
   This area remains hydro-logically connected for more than 20-50\% of the
   year. Results also show that mining areas are located in infrequently
   connected areas (APCD < 20\%), where DPCU values are significantly lower
   than other areas. DPCUs in forestlands are more stable with a growing
   season, that is, similar to 15 days longer than in wetlands. Comparisons
   between hydrologic responses in 2016 and 2080 show that, in 2080,
   maximum snow depths are about 0.7 times smaller, evapotranspiration is
   similar to 0.05 mm higher, capillary soil moisture in DT and NP
   scenarios are 1.01-1.52 mm lower, and the ratio of precipitation to
   potential evapotranspiration is almost the same during the growing
   season. However, at the end of growing season, the ratio is similar to 1
   unit less in 2080 in DT and NP scenarios. Results also demonstrate that
   thinner surficial geological layers in the mining areas (located mostly
   in downstream part of the watershed) lead to their lower hydrologic
   connectivities. Therefore, these areas are more vulnerable to mining
   activity impacts, and their hydrologic response under a changing climate
   should be considered in reclamation planning.}},

Abstract = {{While the influence of antecedent conditions on watershed function is
   widely recognized under typical hydrologic regimes, gaps remain in the
   context of extreme climate events (ECEs). ECEs are those events that far
   exceed seasonal norms of intensity, duration, or impact upon the
   physical environment or ecosystem. In this synthesis, we discuss the
   role of source availability and hydrologic connectivity on antecedent
   conditions and propose a conceptual framework to characterize system
   response to ECEs at the watershed scale. We present four case studies in
   detail that span a range of types of antecedent conditions and type of
   ECE to highlight important controls and feedbacks. Because ECEs have the
   potential to export large amounts of water and materials, their
   occurrence in sequence can disproportionately amplify the response. In
   fact, multiple events may not be considered extreme in isolation, but
   when they occur in close sequence they may lead to extreme responses in
   terms of both supply and transport capacity. Therefore, to advance our
   understanding of these complexities, we need continued development of a
   mechanistic understanding of how antecedent conditions set the stage for
   ECE response across multiple regions and climates, particularly since
   monitoring of these rare events is costly and difficult to obtain.
   Through focused monitoring of critical ecosystems during rare events we
   will also be able to extend and validate modeling studies.
   Cross-regional comparisons are also needed to define characteristics of
   resilient systems. These monitoring, modeling, and synthesis efforts are
   more critical than ever in light of changing climate regimes,
   intensification of human modifications of the landscape, and the
   disproportionate impact of ECEs in highly populated regions.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater contribution to streamflow sustains biodiversity and
   enhances ecosystem services, especially under monsoon-driven climate
   where stream baseflow is often the only available water resource during
   the dry season. We assessed how land use change influences streamflow
   and its groundwater contribution in a small headwater catchment subject
   to shifting cultivation in Montane Southeast Asia. Continuous time
   series of rainfall, reference evapotranspiration, groundwater level,
   stream discharge and electrical conductivity (EC) of surface and
   groundwater were monitored from 2002 to 2007. With the rainfall-runoff
   model GR4J, we investigated temporal changes in the hydrological
   behaviour of the study catchment to verify consistencies with observed
   land use change. An EC-based hydrograph separation method allowed
   estimating the groundwater contribution to 104 stormflow events. Mean
   soil surface crusting rates corresponding to each of the nine land uses
   identified in the catchment were determined using 236 standard 1-m(2)
   micro-plots. Mean plant cover for each land use was assessed in 10 x
   10-m(2) plots. Bedrock topography and soil layers' structure were
   assessed by electrical resistivity tomography to determine pathways of
   subsurface storm flows. Our results indicate that an increase in the
   catchment's areal percentage of fallow from 33\% to 71\% led to a
   decrease in the annual runoff coefficient from 43\% to 26\%. The
   concurrent reduction of soil crusting rate over the catchment, from 48\%
   to 30\%, increased rainwater infiltration. Consecutively, groundwater
   contribution to storm streamflow increased from 83\% to 94\%,
   highlighting the protective role of a dense vegetation cover against
   flash floods. The overall reduction of the annual basin water yield for
   inter-storm streamflow from 450 to 185 nun suggests that the potential
   gain in groundwater recharge was offset by the increased root water
   uptake for evapotranspiration, as confirmed by the drop in the
   groundwater level. This analysis illustrates how two different land uses
   with opposite impacts on soil permeability (i/ extensive soil surface
   crusting under annual crops resulting in limited runoff infiltration or
   ii/ fallow regrowth promoting both infiltration and evapotranspiration)
   both inhibit groundwater recharge. The maintenance of strips of fallow
   buffers between annual crop plots can slow down runoff and locally
   promote infiltration and groundwater recharge while limiting
   evapotranspiration.}},

Title = {{Generality of Hydrologic Transport Limitation of Watershed Organic
   Carbon Flux Across Ecoregions of the United States}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{11702-11711}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Although the flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) through freshwaters
   is nearly equivalent to the net carbon uptake of all terrestrial
   ecosystems, uncertainty remains about how source processes (carbon
   production and location) and transport processes (hydrologic
   connectivity and routing) interact to determine DOC flux across flow
   conditions and ecoregions. This limits our ability to predict the
   fluvial carbon flux responses to changes in climate and land use. We
   used DOC concentration and discharge patterns with ensemble modeling
   techniques to quantify DOC flux behavior for 1,006 U.S. watersheds
   spanning diverse climate and land cover conditions. We found that
   DOCflux was transport-limited (concentration increased with discharge)
   in 80\% of watersheds and that this flux behavior spanned ecoregions and
   watershed sizes. The generality of transport limitation demonstrates how
   coupling discharge models with widely available watershed properties
   could allow DOC flux to be efficiently integrated into landscape and
   Earth system models.
   Plain Language Summary When water flows through ecosystems, it picks up
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from plants and soils, sometimes
   determining whether the ecosystem is a net carbon source or sink. DOC is
   also an important water quality parameter and understanding how it is
   produced and transported affects society's ability to provide water for
   industrial, agricultural, and domestic uses. Because DOC flux through
   rivers varies widely with flow and in different regions, DOC flux
   remains a major source of uncertainty in the global carbon cycle. Based
   on one of the largest and most geographically diverse analyses of river
   DOC dynamics to date, we found surprising similarities in DOC flux
   behavior. From southwestern deserts to northeastern forests, hydrologic
   flow, not DOC sources, determined DOC flux behavior in 80\% of
   watersheds in the conterminous United States. In other words, DOC
   concentration systematically increased with river flow, even during
   large flow events, indicating that organic matter stocks provide ample
   DOC to maintain delivery to rivers. Additional analysis of this large
   data set identified several landscape and climate conditions that
   predict DOC flux behavior in watersheds. Together, these findings
   demonstrate that watershed DOC flux can be simulated across spatial
   scales using river flow and widely available watershed properties.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A large variety of barriers can affect longitudinal connectivity, which
   leads to shipping blocking and even flood hazard. However, few existing
   methods can quantify physically the river channel connectivity from the
   barrier's details perspective in a watershed. This paper establishes a
   new model of the River Channel Connectivity Index (RCCI) to quantify the
   unobstructed degree of river flow in river channels within geographic
   information system (GIS ) platforms based on the modified concept of
   time accessibility. A comprehensive classification system of barriers is
   setup before these barriers are identified by the remote sensing
   technology. The model is applied to Dashi Watershed in suburban Beijing,
   China. Results show that submersible bridges and sediment siltation are
   the main barriers in the watershed. RCCI values in the mountainous areas
   are generally higher than that of the plains. The assessment results
   verified by two historical flood events show that the RCCI can reveal
   where the river channel connectivity is impaired, how serious it is, and
   what the reason is for managers. Through scenarios' results, the best
   restoration measure for each tributary is obtained from the perspective
   of reducing flood hazards. The new RCCI method not only has
   methodological significance, but also helps policymakers to enhance
   river flooding reduction and determine restoration priorities of the

Title = {{Spatial and Temporal Variability of the Impacts of Pinyon and Juniper
   Reduction on Hydrologic and Erosion Processes Across Climatic Gradients
   in the Western US: A Regional Synthesis}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Pinyon (Pinus spp.) and juniper (Juniperus spp.) woodlands are an
   important vegetation type in the Great Basin, Colorado Plateau, and
   southwestern desert regions of the western US that is undergoing
   substantial changes associated with land management, altered disturbance
   regimes, and climate change. We synthesized literature on the
   ecohydrologic impacts of pinyon and juniper tree reductions across plot
   to watershed scales, short- and long-term periods, and regional climatic
   gradients. We found that the initial plot- to hillslope-scale
   ecohydrologic and erosion impacts of tree reduction on pinyon and
   juniper woodlands by fire, mechanical tree removal, or drought depend
   largely on: (1) the degree to which these perturbations alter vegetation
   and ground cover structure, (2) initial conditions, and (3) inherent
   site attributes. Fire commonly imparts an initial increased risk for
   hillslope runoff and erosion that degrades over time with vegetation and
   ground cover recovery whereas tree reductions by mechanical means pose
   fewer initial negative ecohydrologic impacts. Tree reduction by either
   approach can enhance understory vegetation and improve site-level
   ecohydrologic function over time, particularly on sites with an
   initially favorable cover of native herbaceous vegetation and a
   cool-season precipitation regime. Understory vegetation and ground cover
   enhancements appear to increase ecohydrologic resilience of some
   woodland communities to disturbances such as drought, fire, and insect
   infestations. In contrast, intensive land use, prolonged drought or
   repeated burning associated with invasions of fire-prone grasses can
   propagate long-term site degradation through persistent elevated runoff
   and erosion rates. Our synthesis suggests the annual precipitation
   requirement for increases in plot- to hillslope-scale soil water
   availability for herbaceous enhancement through tree removal likely
   ranges from 200-400 mm for sites in the Great Basin and northern
   Colorado Plateau (cool-season precipitation regimes), and, although
   suggested with great uncertainty, likely exceeds 400 mm for woodlands
   with rain-dominated precipitation regimes in the southwestern US.
   Overall, literature is inconclusive regarding tree reduction impacts on
   watershed-scale changes in groundwater and streamflow. To date, there is
   little evidence that drought-related changes to vegetation in pinyon and
   juniper woodlands substantially affect watershed-scale water
   availability and streamflow at the annual time scale. Our synthesis
   identifies key knowledge gaps to overcome in improving understanding of
   the ecohydrologic and erosion impacts of broadly occurring pinyon and
   juniper tree reductions in the western US.}},

   Basins under Varying Hydroclimatic Conditions}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Non-point source (NPS) pollution from agricultural lands is the leading
   cause of various water quality problems across the United States.
   Particularly, surface depressions often alter the releasing patterns of
   NPS pollutants into the environment. However, most commonly-used
   hydrologic models may not be applicable to such depression-dominated
   regions. The objective of this study is to improve water
   quantity/quality modeling and its calibration for depression-dominated
   basins under wet and dry hydroclimatic conditions. Specifically, the
   Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied for hydrologic and
   water quality modeling in the Red River of the North Basin (RRB).
   Surface depressions across the RRB were incorporated into the model by
   employing a surface delineation method and the impacts of depressions
   were evaluated for two modeling scenarios, MS1 (basic scenario) and MS2
   (depression-oriented scenario). Moreover, a traditional calibration
   scheme (CS1) was compared to a wet-dry calibration scheme (CS2) that
   accounted for the effects of hydroclimatic variations on hydrologic and
   water quality modeling. Results indicated that the surface runoff
   simulation and the associated water quality modeling were improved when
   topographic characteristics of depressions were incorporated into the
   model (MS2). The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) coefficient indicated
   an average increase of 30.4\% and 19.6\% from CS1 to CS2 for the
   calibration and validation periods, respectively. Additionally, the CS2
   provided acceptable simulations of water quality, with the NSE values of
   0.50 and 0.74 for calibration and validation periods, respectively.
   These results highlight the enhanced capability of the proposed approach
   for simulating water quantity and quality for depression-dominated
   basins under the influence of varying hydroclimatic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems refers to the
   process-based connections between upstream and downstream areas and is
   fundamental to understanding the dynamic and nonlinear hydrological
   behaviour of river basins. However, the quantification of such
   connectivity remains a challenge due to the absence of a consensus on
   the appropriate data and methods, especially in delta plains. In this
   study, based on the difference between water level fluctuations at
   adjacent stations, a new and quantitative longitudinal functional
   connectivity index (LFCI) was developed for delta plains. Focusing on
   the Taihu Plain, we then analysed the spatial-temporal changes in the
   LFCI during 1960-2012 and investigated the correlations between the LFCI
   and climate change and human activities. We found that the decadal,
   annual and seasonal changes in the average LFCI all presented slightly
   increasing trends in the recent 50 period, but the annual average LFCI
   increased significantly after 1978; the average LFCIs in June, July, and
   August of the flood season were less than those in other months in the
   Taihu Plain. We also found that the spatial-temporal changes in the
   average LFCI exhibited larger differences at the subregional and station
   scales; those in the Wu-Cheng-Xi-Yu subregion were least, and the
   average LFCIs at stations near the borders of adjacent subregions were
   less than those at other stations. Moreover, we found that the average
   LFCI had significant correlations with precipitation, river density and
   water surface ratio. Our results were consistent with common sense

   quite effectively quantify the longitudinal functional connectivity of

Abstract = {{Environmental flows are a critical tool for addressing ecological
   degradation of river systems brought about by increasing demand for
   limited water resources. The importance of basin scale management of
   environmental flows has long been recognized as necessary if managers
   are to achieve social, economic, and environmental objectives. The
   challenges in managing environmental flows are now emerging and include
   the time taken for changes to become manifest, uncertainty around
   large-scale responses to environmental flows and that most interventions
   take place at smaller scales. The purpose of this paper is to describe
   how conceptual models can be used to inform the development, and
   subsequent evaluation of ecological objectives for environmental flows
   at the basin scale. Objective setting is the key initial step in
   environmental flow planning and subsequently provides a foundation for
   effective adaptive management. We use the implementation of the Basin
   Plan in Australia's Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) as an example of the role
   of conceptual models in the development of environmental flow objectives
   and subsequent development of intervention monitoring and evaluation,
   key steps in the adaptive management of environmental flows. The
   implementation of the Basin Plan was based on the best science available
   at the time, however, this was focused on ecosystem responses to
   environmental flows. The monitoring has started to reveal that
   limitations in our conceptualization of the basin may reduce the
   likelihood of achieving of basin scale objectives. One of the strengths
   of the Basin Plan approach was that it included multiple conceptual
   models informing environmental flow management. The experience in the
   MDB suggests that the development of multiple conceptual models at the
   basin scale will help increase the likelihood that basin-scale
   objectives will be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Paleoenvironmental reconstructions are increasingly being used in
   conservation biology, ecosystem management, and evaluations of ecosystem
   services (ES), but their potential to contribute to the ES risk
   assessment process has not been explored. We propose that the long-term
   history of the ecosystem provides valuable information that augments and
   strengthens an ES risk assessment and that it should be considered
   routinely when undertaking risk assessments. We adjusted a standard
   ecosystem-based risk management (EBRM) protocol to include
   paleoenvironmental data, and tested the modified approach on two coastal
   lagoons in South America. Paleolimnological reconstructions in both
   lagoons indicate that salinity and nutrients (in Laguna de Rocha), and
   salinity (in Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta), as controlled by hydrologic
   connectivity with the ocean and freshwater tributaries, have been the
   key variables behind ecosystem's function. This understanding, applied
   to inform various components and steps in the EBRM protocol, suggests
   that the maintenance of hydrological connections should be a management
   priority to minimize risk to ES. This work illustrates the utility of
   including paleoenvironmental data in an EBRM context and highlights the
   need for a more holistic approach to risk management by incorporating

Abstract = {{Analyzing a response of catchments to rainfall inputs allows for deeper
   insights on the mechanisms of runoff generation at catchment scale. In
   this study an automated time series-based event separation procedure
   consisting of available base flow separation, runoff event
   identification, and rainfall attribution methods and of a novel
   iterative procedure for the adjustment of thresholds used to identify
   single-peak components of multiple-peak events is proposed. Event runoff
   coefficient, time scale, rise time, and peak discharge of more than
   220,000 identified rainfall-runoff events are then used to analyze
   dynamics of event runoff response in 185 catchments at multiple temporal
   scales. In mountainous catchments with poor storage event runoff
   response is strongly controlled by the characteristics of rainfall and
   is generated by event-fed saturation or infiltration excess. A distinct
   switch between saturated and unsaturated states occurs in these
   catchments. A weak relation between rainfall and runoff event properties
   is instead observed in lowland and hilly catchments with substantial
   storage, where a gradual transformation between functioning states
   occurs and the response is driven by preevent saturation. The
   seasonality of their event characteristics is governed by the
   contribution of snowmelt and the seasonality of the aridity index rather
   than of rainfall properties. Long-term changes of total precipitation
   amount alone do not explain season-specific long-term changes of event
   characteristics that are rather consistent with changes of seasonal
   indicators of the wetness state. The effects of land use changes are
   detectable only in a few cases and display themselves mostly in the
   characteristic response time of catchments.}},

Abstract = {{Dedolomitization converts a dolomite into a calcite, and conventionally
   is interpreted to form in an eogenetic or telogenetic diagenetic
   environment where meteoric water dissolves evaporites to supply excess
   calcium. Hydrologic connectivity between a dolostone and the surface
   water may then lead to a dedolomitized interval, often times being a
   diagnostic indicator for an erosional unconformity, subaerial exposure,
   and/or karst. In contrast to the classic models, we present a case study
   for pervasive burial dedolomitization, unrelated to meteoric fluids.
   Dedolomitization of the Zechstein-2-Carbonate (Ca2) gas reservoir in NW
   Germany is strongly altering reservoir quality on a regional scale. The
   Ca2 shows a textbook correlation between reservoir quality and
   mineralogy. Petrographic analyses show that approximately 80\% of all
   observed calcite reveal a dedolomite microtexture, causing a reduction
   of average matrix porosity by 5 to 10\% compared to the dolomite.
   Dedolomite follows initial layering and abundantly forms massive
   concretions, which are surrounded by compaction-related curvature of the
   depositional layering in the dolomite host rock. Such an early burial
   timing is supported by a slight burial-related shift of similar to 3
   parts per thousand delta O-18 and similar to 1 parts per thousand delta
   C-13 towards lighter values in the dedolomites compared to dolomite. An
   exceptionally large amount of calcium-rich fluids must have been
   mobilized to account for > 50\% of the Ca2 rock volume to be
   dedolomitized. However, core fabrics related to meteoric diagenesis,
   such as karst fabrics or typical fresh water stable isotope signatures
   have been observed neither in the Ca2 nor in over- and underlying
   anhydrite beds. Instead, excess calcium likely comes from
   gypsum-to-anhydrite conversion and pressure solution within over- and
   underlying anhydrites. An influx of strontium-rich waters from the
   anhydrite beds is indicated by up to 5 times higher strontium contents
   measured in dedolomite fabrics compared to their dolomite host rock.
   Homogenization temperatures between 51 and 56 degrees C measured in some
   early fluid inclusions in dedolomite textures further exclude a pristine
   meteoric water input and suggest fluid entrapment in a burial depth
   range of 900 to 1400 m. Comparing these results with literature data
   furthermore indicates that mesogenetic dedolomite is either
   volumetrically underestimated in other carbonate-evaporite settings or
   formed under unique diagenetic conditions across the Southern Permian
   Basin during Zechstein times.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape metrics are often used to model nonpoint source pollution from
   agricultural and urban surface runoff. By considering topography and the
   spatial arrangement of land cover, landscape metrics can better account
   for hydrologic connectivity, loading quantity, and vegetated buffer
   filtering between nutrient loading sources and streams. For this study
   we develop a surface runoff nutrient loading metric that considers
   source (i.e. cropland or developed) loading and buffer filtering along
   hydrologic transport vectors, or flow paths. We use General Additive
   Modeling to evaluate the relationship between this metric and in-stream
   nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in the Saginaw Bay
   watershed in Michigan, US and compare the relative predictive power
   between this metric and other landscape metrics that do not consider
   hydrologic connectivity. The flow path based cropland loading metric was
   a stronger predictor of in-stream NO3 concentrations than alternative
   metrics. In-stream P concentrations were best predicted by models that
   included 48-h antecedent precipitation and catchment-wide proportion of
   developed landcover. Metric maps reveal high nutrient loading areas
   where only a small proportion of loading reaches streams via surface
   runoff, highlighting the need to consider nutrient loading via drainage
   tiles and other subsurface pathways in efforts to quantify nonpoint
   source loading to surface waters. The flow path-based loading metric is
   represented spatially as a gridded dataset showing estimates of nutrient
   loading adjacent to streams, and with higher resolution stream
   delineation data it could be used by land managers to target locations
   for precision buffer placement to intercept surface runoff and reduce

Abstract = {{In contrast to spatial inequality, there are currently no methods for

   efficacy. The objective of this study was to use Lorenz curves to
   quantify temporal inequality in surface runoff and tile drainage,
   identify controls on nutrient loading in these flowpaths, and develop
   design flows for structural conservation practices. Surface runoff (n =
   94 site-years) and tile drainage (n = 90 site-years) were monitored on
   40 fields in Ohio. Results showed, on average, 80\% of nitrate-nitrogen,
   soluble reactive phosphorus (P), and total P loads occurred between 7
   and 12 days per year in surface runoff and between 32 and 58 days per
   year in tile drainage. Similar temporal inequality between discharge and
   load provided evidence that loading was transport-limited and
   highlighted the critical role hydrologic connectivity plays in nutrient
   delivery from tile-drained fields. Design flow criterion for sizing
   structural practices based on load reduction goals was developed by
   combining Lorenz curves and flow duration curves. Comparing temporal

   Ludwigia hexapetala, an invasive emergent macrophyte, provides a case
   study for understanding dispersal patterns throughout a watershed. The
   species spreads via hydrochory and is increasingly imposing detrimental
   ecological and economic impacts within watersheds of the United States

   dispersal in the Russian River watershed of California, capturing shoot
   fragments of L. hexapetala during repeated summer surveys at five
   locations in the river and quantifying their morphological traits that
   predict establishment success. Highly variable capture counts suggest
   the importance of pulse disturbance events in local dispersal of L.
   hexapetala. Unexpectedly, dispersing propagule pressure was nonlinear,
   with more shoot fragments captured in the middle rather than lower
   river. Captured fragments in the middle river were twice the length of
   fragments captured in the lower river and bore 83\% more stem nodes,

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes the initial results (first 4 yr) of a
   whole-catchment manipulation to evaluate the impact of a loss of
   hydrologic connectivity of a boreal lake with its watershed on lake
   thermal and evaporative regimes. We diverted the upstream flow to a
   fourth order lake resulting in a marked reduction (81\%) in watershed
   area, and compared the response to a comparable control lake in a
   headwater position. The manipulation reduced runoff into the
   experimental lake from 2400 mm to 90 mm, greatly increased theoretical
   residence time (from 2.3 yr to 18.3 yr), and reduced average dissolved
   organic carbon concentration from 5.8 +/- 0.3 mg L-1 to 5.5 +/- 0.3 mg
   L-1. Average Secchi depth was increased by 0.6 m, resulting in a 0.25 m
   deeper epilimnion and cooler surface water temperatures (8\% of the
   time) than those predicted by pre-manipulation relationships. There was
   some evidence that the response of evaporation to episodic events was
   altered, but this was not extensive enough to alter annual evaporation
   or median evaporation rates. Our findings show that the impacts of
   hydrologic connectivity on lake chemistry can cascade to alter the
   energy budgets of boreal lakes. These results can inform how differences
   in hydrological connectivity across the landscape due to lake-watershed
   topology and climate will impact boreal lakes. Of note is that very
   clear lakes in the boreal region are highly sensitive to impacts from a
   change in clarity. Information on their spatial distribution will be
   necessary to assess impacts of hydrological connectivity on the boreal

Abstract = {{Hillslopes exert critical controls on the quality and quantity of
   downstream waters. To understand and model dominant headwater catchment
   processes, we need to estimate the relative importance of different
   runoff generation processes. In this work we analyze published data from
   studies of 17 hillslopes from a range of landscapes to better understand
   the relative role of interflow, that is, shallow lateral subsurface flow
   moving over a layer impeding percolation, in streamflow generation. For
   each slope, we calculated downslope interflow travel distances, that is,
   the potential distance a water parcel travels downslope above an
   impeding layer until it percolates into the impeding layer. The
   downslope travel distances for the 17 hillslopes ranged from around 1 m
   to several hundred meters. The vector analysis of downslope travel
   distances revealed that all but three hillslopes had slope lengths that
   were much longer than downslope travel distances. For the remaining 14
   cases we could show that most water perched above a shallow impeding
   layer percolates through the impeding layer before reaching the valley
   or the stream channel. Thus, interflow usually contributes directly to
   valley water or streamflow only from the lower portions of the hillslope
   in most landscapes. A critical finding of our analysis is that a
   continuously perched saturated zone with downslope flow does not imply
   continuous connectivity to the stream. Such a continuous connectivity is
   the exception rather than the rule in most landscapes. Future hillslope
   and headwater processes and modeling studies will need to account for

Abstract = {{Water movement in hillslopes is determined by the subsurface
   characteristics that control flow paths connecting precipitation to
   stream flow. The hydrological response of hillslopes is notoriously
   non-linear and non-stationary; with the relative importance of vertical
   and lateral flow paths also depending on event characteristics and
   antecedent conditions. In northern boreal regions, climate change
   projections indicate that wetter and warmer winter conditions are likely
   to generate more extreme flood events. Here, we report a study from an
   upland catchment in northern Scotland where a monitoring year provided
   an opportunity to contextualise observations during the hillslope
   response to a winter rainfall event that locally caused the most extreme
   flooding for over 200 years. Monitoring the hillslope water table, soil
   moisture and isotopes in precipitation, groundwater and stream flow
   provided invaluable insight into hillslope-riparian coupling.
   Groundwater with a shallow water table ( < 0.05 m deep) in poorly
   drained valley bottom drift deposits maintained almost fully saturated
   and stream-connected peat soil profiles in riparian areas. In the
   wettest periods, the groundwater beneath the peat was artesian. On
   steeper hillslopes, soils were drier and the water table was generally
   deeper (0.5-1 m below ground level), though the profile could fully
   saturate and groundwater levels reach the surface during the wettest
   period. Groundwater in deeper wells typically showed an anti-clockwise
   hysteresis compared to stream flow, and peak levels typically lagged
   behind the stream by a few hours in the valley bottom and > 1 day in the
   upper hillslope. In contrast, shallower wells in the soil profiles in
   the riparian area showed a more responsive perched groundwater system
   with transmissivity feedback in the upper soil layers resulting in much
   more rapid responses which generally peaked before the stream and
   exhibited clockwise hysteresis. Analysis of stable isotopes in
   precipitation, groundwater and streamflow, indicated that groundwater
   was remarkably well mixed with limited fractionation effects, inferring
   precipitation on the upper, unconfined hillslopes was the dominant
   source of recharge - particularly during the winter. The study shows
   that groundwater plays two roles in generating stream flow: a constant
   baseflow supply to the stream and time varying-exfiltration into the
   edge of the riparian zone, which contributes to surface runoff during
   storm events.}},

Abstract = {{A growing body of research suggests that different land use activities
   may alter both the quantity and quality of dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) exported from terrestrial landscapes. However, little is known
   about DOC from mixed-use landscapes where hydrology varies seasonally.
   This study examined how DOC and chemical properties of stream water were
   related to land use, drainage area, and streamflow in mixed-use
   landscape in the Willamette River Basin, Oregon. Stream water samples
   were collected at roughly monthly intervals over three water years from
   21 sites whose drainage areas ranged from 1 to>11,000 km(2) and included
   pasture, forest, and developed land uses. DOC properties were
   characterized using PARAFAC (parallel factor) analyses of 3-D excitation
   and emission matrices (EEMs). We used the Cory-McKnight (CM) model, and
   we also developed a model unique to our samples. Thirteen components
   were identified using the CM model, and these were highly correlated
   with, and similar with respect to excitation and emission to the three
   components identified in our site-specific model. Fluorescent components
   of DOC were related to discharge and land cover, but not to drainage
   area. In our model, one component (C1) appeared to be associated with
   terrestrial detritus and was greater in streamflow from sites with
   forest/developed cover than from sites with high pasture cover. A second
   component (C2) was greater in streamflow from high-pasture sites than
   from high-forest sites. C2 was strongly correlated with a protein
   component identified in the CM model, and therefore we attributed this
   second component to more microbially-processed DOC. C1 increased
   significantly with discharge for both land covers, suggesting that
   periods of high flow produce less microbially-processed DOC from more
   surficial flow. C2 decreased significantly with discharge for both land
   covers, suggesting that deeper hydrologic flow paths produce more
   soil-associated, microbially processed DOC. SUVA254, often used as an
   index of chemical quality and aromaticity of DOC, was related only to
   streamflow but not land use, suggesting that while the chemistry of DOC
   differed among land use types as detected by EEMs analysis, the
   aromaticity of the DOC did not differ. The CM model and our
   site-specific model provided consistent results: those components that
   were highest in high pasture sites were also highest at low flow and
   appeared to be more microbially processed; components that were highest
   in low pasture sites were also greatest at high flow and appeared to
   reflect less microbially processed DOC. Taken together, these findings
   are consistent with a conceptual model of how differences in DOC
   chemistry among landscape types reflect differences in plant litter
   input chemistry, hydrologic connectivity, and degree of microbial
   processing. Such changes in DOC quality with land-use change can affect
   foodweb dynamics in receiving waters and change the balance between
   carbon storage and carbon flux to the atmosphere, and they imply that
   even non-intensive agricultural land use can have significant effects on
   terrestrial-aquatic carbon processes.}},

Abstract = {{Landscapes and water are closely linked. Water shapes landscapes, and
   landscape heterogeneity in turn determines water storage, partitioning,
   and movement. Understanding hydrological processes from an ecological
   perspective is an exciting and fast-growing field of research.
   The motivation of this paper is to review advances in the interaction
   between landscape heterogeneity and hydrological processes, and propose
   a framework for synthesizing and moving forward.
   Landscape heterogeneity, mainly topography and land cover, has been
   widely incorporated into existing hydrological models, but not in a
   systematic way. Topography, as one of the most important landscape
   traits, has been extensively used in hydrological models, but mostly to
   drive water flow downhill. Land cover heterogeneity, represented mostly
   by vegetation, is usually linked with evaporation and transpiration
   rather than runoff generation. Moreover, the proportion of different
   land cover types is usually the only index involved in hydrological
   models, leaving the influence of vegetation patterns and structure on
   hydrologic connectivity still largely unexplored. Additionally, moving
   from ``what heterogeneity exists{''} to ``why-type{''} questions
   probably offers us new insights into the nexus of landscape and water.
   We believe that the principles of self-organization and co-evolution of
   landscape features shed light on the possibility to infer subsurface
   heterogeneity from a few observable landscapes, allowing us to simplify
   complexity to a few quantifiable metrics, and utilizing these metrics in
   models with sufficient heterogeneity but limited complexity.
   Landscape-based models can also be beneficial to improve our ability of
   prediction in ungauged basins and prediction in a changing environment
   (Panta Rhei, everything flows).}},

Abstract = {{Watershed urbanization leads to chemical and thermal pollution of urban
   streams and significant declines in aquatic biodiversity. Most
   investigators have focused on variation in total watershed impervious
   surface cover (ISC) as the primary driver of urban stream degradation.
   We asked instead whether the degree of connectivity between ISC and
   urban stream channels alters its effect. We compared 7 streams in the
   Raleigh-Durham metropolitan area of the southeastern USA that drained
   watersheds with similar amounts of pavement (ISC = 7-16\% of watershed
   area) but spanning a wide range of hydrologic connectivity between these
   pavements and their receiving streams via both subsurface (pipe density
   range: 1.1-6.9 km/km(2)) and surface (road density range: 5.8-10.7 km/
   km(2) ) flowpaths. Despite draining watersheds with similarly low levels
   of development, these 7 streams exhibited remarkable variability in
   their hydrologic and thermal regimes and varied in their
   macroinvertebrate diversity from a low of only 11 taxa to a high of 22.
   Both macroinvertebrate community composition and the tissue
   concentrations of Cu, Pb, and Zn in 3 stream invertebrate taxa
   (Cambaridae, Tipulidae, and Hydropsychidae) found across all sites were
   correlated with watershed hydrologic connectivity. These results suggest
   that the connectivity of ISC may drive considerable variation in the
   magnitude of ecosystem degradation associated with the same level of
   watershed development, with less connected or disconnected impervious
   surfaces having proportionally lower negative effects on aquatic
   organisms.}},

Volume = {{493}},

Abstract = {{Stream chemistry reflects the mixture of complex biogeochemical
   reactions that vary across space and time within watersheds. For
   example, streams experience changing hydrologic connectivity to
   heterogeneous water sources under different flow regimes; however, it
   remains unclear how seasonal flow paths link these different sources and
   regulate concentration-discharge behavior, i.e., changes in stream
   solute concentration as a function of discharge. At the Susquehanna
   Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (SSHCZO) in central Pennsylvania,
   USA, concentrations of chemostatic solutes (K, Mg, Na, Si, Cl) vary
   little across a wide range of discharge values while concentrations of
   chemodynamic solutes (Fe, Mn, Ca) decrease sharply with increasing
   stream discharge. To elucidate controls on chemodynamic solute behavior,
   we investigated the chemistry of surface water and shallow subsurface
   water at the SSHCZO in early autumn when discharge was negligible and
   concentrations of chemodynamic solutes were high. Dissolved ions,
   colloids, and micron-sized particles were extracted from hillslope soils
   and stream sediments to evaluate how elements were mobilized into pore
   waters and transported from hillslopes to the stream.
   During the study period when flow was intermittent, the stream consisted
   of isolated puddles that were chemically variable along the length of
   the channel. Inputs of subsurface water to the stream were limited to an
   area of upwelling near the stream headwaters, and the water table
   remained over a meter below the stream bed along the rest of the
   channel. Chemodynamic elements Fe and Mn were preferentially mobilized
   from organic-rich soils as a mixture of dissolved ions, colloids, and
   micron-sized particles; consequently, subsurface water draining
   organic-rich soils in the upper catchment was enriched in Fe and Mn.
   Conversely, Ca increased towards the catchment outlet and was primarily
   mobilized from stream sediments as Ca2+. Concentrations of chemostatic
   solutes were relatively invariable throughout the catchment.
   We conclude that chemodynamic behavior at SSHCZO is driven by seasonally
   variable connectivity between the stream and hillslope soils. During the
   dry season, stream water derives from a shallow perched water table
   (interflow) that upwells to generate metal-rich stream headwaters. High
   concentrations of soluble Fe and Mn at low discharge occur when
   metal-rich headwaters are flushed to the catchment outlet during
   periodic rain events. Interflow during the dry season originates from
   water that infiltrates through organic-rich swales; thus, metals in the
   stream at low flow are ultimately derived from convergent hillslopes
   where biological processes have concentrated and/or mobilized these
   chemodynamic elements. In contrast, high concentrations of Ca2+ at low
   discharge are likely mobilized from stream sediments that contain
   secondary calcite precipitates. We infer that chemodynamic solutes are
   diluted at high discharge primarily due to increased flow through planar
   hillslopes. This study highlights how spatially heterogeneous
   biogeochemistry and seasonally variable flow paths regulate
   concentration-discharge behavior within catchments.}},

Abstract = {{The capacity of forest soils to store organic carbon is influenced by
   changing hydrologic connectivity. We hypothesized that hydrologic
   connectivity, the water-mediated transfer of matter and energy between
   different landscape positions, controls the partitioning between aquatic
   and atmospheric soil carbon fates. Results from a 5-year study of a
   northern hardwood forested catchment indicated that hydrologic
   connectivity affected both the magnitude and fate of carbon export.
   Atmospheric carbon export was the major export pathway from the
   catchment; its rate was regulated by topographic position (i.e.,
   uplands, ecotones, and wetlands) but enhanced or supressed through
   changes in soil moisture and hydrologic connectivity. Wetter soil
   conditions reduced CO2 flux from the ecotones and wetlands where
   microbial respiration was oxygen-limited, whereas drier soil conditions
   that decreased hydrologic connectivity increased CO2 flux by relieving
   the oxygen limitation. In contrast, aquatic carbon export was a minor
   export pathway from the catchment and was driven by hydrologic
   connectivity, with less carbon export during relatively low discharge
   years. Past trends suggest a shift to a warmer climate and changes in
   the timing, duration, and intensity of hydrologic connectivity that are
   leading to an increase in annual atmospheric carbon export but a
   decrease in annual aquatic carbon export, despite the intensification of
   autumn storms. The increase in atmospheric carbon export creates a
   positive feedback for climate warming that will further disrupt
   hydrologic connectivity and aquatic carbon export, with consequences for
   downstream streams and lakes.}},

Abstract = {{The Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta (CGSM), Colombia is possibly the
   wetland that has experienced the largest mangrove mortality on record
   due to modification of hydrologic connectivity and consequent
   hypersaline conditions. We used hydroclimatic, salinity and mangrove
   basal area data collected in five stations from 1993 to 2015 to study
   the relation between ongoing mangrove recovery, changes in salinity in
   the wetland and hydroclimatic changes in precipitation, potential
   evapotranspiration and freshwater inputs. We found that until 2015, the
   mangrove ecosystems in CGSM are in general terms in a path of recovery
   due to the combined effect of favorable hydroclimatic conditions and
   management operations to increase freshwater inputs into the wetland. We
   observed in three stations that the annual growth of mangrove basal area
   increased as pore water salinity decreased. Regarding surface water
   salinity, El Nino/Southern Oscillation explained most of the
   inter-annual variability in the wet season by regulating freshwater and
   in the dry season by regulating potential evaporation from the wetland.
   However, persistent channel reopening appeared to be the cause for the
   largest salinity decreases, whereas lack of persistent dredging slowed
   recovery in other areas. The monitoring of the
   mangrove-salinity-hydroclimate system must continue in order to increase
   its understanding and to avoid more recurring episodes of mangrove
   mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional delineation and modeling methods do not consider the spatial
   arrangement and dynamic threshold control of surface depressions.
   Instead, full structural hydrologic connectivity, uniform well-connected
   drainage networks, and an invariant contributing area are often assumed.
   In reality, depressions play an important role in quantifying functional
   connected areas (ACs) and contributing area. This study is aimed to
   develop a new procedure to analyze functional hydrologic connectivity
   related to topography at a mesoscale, specifically in
   depression-dominated areas by (a) characterizing surface topography, (b)
   quantifying and locating dynamic hydrologic connectivity, and (c)
   analyzing hydrologic connectivity and threshold-controlled dynamics of
   contributing area using a set of dimensionless indicators and a new
   normalized connected area function. Thorough analyses for different
   topographic surfaces provided improved understanding of the intrinsic
   relationship and interaction between structural and functional
   hydrologic connectivity patterns. In addition, the new procedure was
   compared against a traditional delineation method, terrain analysis
   using digital elevation models (TauDEM), to determine structural and
   functional connectivity. It was found that spatial arrangement and scale
   of depressions had a direct effect on hydrologic connectivity. A
   stepwise trend, unique to depression-dominated areas, highlighted the
   effect of threshold behaviors on contributing area and ACs. Conversely,
   dendritic surfaces showed an expedited surface connectivity due to the
   assumption of depressionless topography. Thus, precisely locating and
   quantifying ACs and contributing area via the new analysis procedure
   improve our understanding of the mechanisms of topography-controlled
   overland flow and sediment transport dynamics, and hence, the findings
   are valuable in making informed decisions about water quantity and

Abstract = {{Ice-wedge polygons are widespread and conspicuous surficial expressions
   of ground-ice in permafrost landscapes. Thawing of ice wedges triggers
   differential ground subsidence, local ponding, and persistent changes to
   vegetation and hydrologic connectivity across the landscape. Here we
   characterize spatio-temporal patterns of ice-wedge degradation since
   circa 1950 across environmental gradients on Alaska's North Slope. We
   used a spectral thresholding approach validated by field observations to
   map flooded thaw pits in high-resolution images from circa 1950, 1982,
   and 2012 for 11 study areas (1577-4460 ha). The total area of flooded
   pits increased since 1950 at 8 of 11 study areas (median change +3.6 ha;
   130.3\%). There were strong regional differences in the timing and
   extent of degradation; flooded pits were already extensive by 1950 on
   the Chukchi coastal plain (alluvial-marine deposits) and subsequent
   changes there indicate pit stabilization. Degradation began more
   recently on the central Beaufort coastal plain (eolian sand) and Arctic
   foothills (yedoma). Our results indicate that ice-wedge degradation in
   northern Alaska cannot be explained by late-20th century warmth alone.
   Likely mechanisms for asynchronous onset include landscape-scale
   differences in surficial materials and ground-ice content, regional
   climate gradients from west (maritime) to east (continental), and
   regional differences in the timing and magnitude of extreme warm summers

Abstract = {{Creating or recruiting new riparian forests to improve Lower Putah Creek
   (LPC) ecosystem functions is challenging under the modified stream flow
   regime developed after historic gravel mining and installation of
   Monticello Dam upstream. Hydrologic connectivity between riparian trees,
   shallow groundwater, and the low flow channel is essential towards
   maintaining these forests and related habitats through the annual summer
   and multi-year drought periods typical in this Sacramento Valley region
   of California. Despite increased average summer flows, significant
   mature cottonwood and willow tree mortality along the LPC riparian areas
   below the Putah Creek diversion dam in 2014 raised concerns over the
   soil and hydrologic factors affecting riparian vegetation survival. A
   forensic analysis was conducted combining annual canopy coverage
   fractions and tree ring studies with daily soil-water balances, low flow
   records, and available groundwater level Information from the past few
   decades to determine the key hydrologic factors affecting riparian tree
   survival along the LPC. The 2011-2016 drought was linked with greater
   than prior average soil-water deficits in 2012-2015 and lower initial
   soil-water storage on March 1 of 2012 and 2014 that would be expected to
   stress the trees. However, such stress was not apparent in decreased
   tree ring spacing during this period from mature (40-50 years old),
   deceased, and living trees. Tree canopy coverage declined dramatically
   (by as much as 50\% as compared to the previous decade average) only in
   the summer of the 2014 despite a similar to 35\% increase in average
   summer flows from 2011 to 2014. However, the regional water table
   aquifer levels declined at an average rate of similar to 35 mm/day in
   2014 (as compared to similar to 17 mm/day in previous decade) and by
   several meters overall between 2011 and 2016 suggesting that deceased
   trees lacked access to the water table aquifer or lateral stream
   seepage. The increased rates of water table decline and overall depth
   may be associated with a large increase in adjacent irrigated almond
   orchard areas in 2014-2016. Knowledge of the dynamic hydrologic factors
   controlling sustainability of riparian trees should better inform and

Abstract = {{Large wood (LW) plays an essential role in aquatic ecosystem health and
   function. Traditionally, LW has been removed from streams to minimize
   localized flooding and increase conveyance efficiency. More recently, LW
   is often added to streams as a component of stream and river restoration
   activities. While much research has focused on the role of LW in habitat
   provisioning, geomorphic stability, and hydraulics at low to medium
   flows, we know little about the role of LW during storm events. To
   address this question, we investigated the role of LW on floodplain
   connectivity along a headwater stream in the Mid-Atlantic region of the
   United States. Specifically, we conducted two artificial floods, one
   with and one without LW, and then utilized field measurements in
   conjunction with hydrodynamic modeling to quantify floodplain
   connectivity during the experimental floods and to characterize
   potential management variables for optimized restoration activities.
   Experimental observations show that the addition of LW increased maximum
   floodplain inundation extent by 34\%, increased floodplain inundation
   depth by 33\%, and decreased maximum thalweg velocity by 10\%. Model
   results demonstrated that different placement of LW along the reach has
   the potential to increase floodplain flow by up to 40\%, with highest
   flooding potential at cross sections with high longitudinal velocity and
   shallow depth. Additionally, model simulations show that the effects of
   LW on floodplain discharge decrease as storm recurrence interval
   increases, with no measurable impact at a recurrence interval of more
   than 25 years.}},

Abstract = {{Channel transmission losses alter the streamflow response of arid and
   semiarid watersheds and promote focused groundwater recharge. This
   process has been primarily studied in dryland channels draining large
   areas that are displaced away from hillslope runoff generation. In
   contrast, small watersheds on arid piedmont slopes allow the
   investigation of interactive hillslope and channel processes that
   control the partitioning between surface and subsurface flows. In this
   study, we utilize high-resolution, long-term measurements of water
   balance components in an instrumented watershed of the Chihuahuan Desert
   to set up, parameterize, and test a process-based, distributed
   hydrologic model modified to account for channel losses. A transient
   method for capturing capillary effects in channels results in
   simulations with a reliable representation of the watershed energy
   balance, soil moisture dynamics, hillslope infiltration, channel
   transmission (or percolation) losses, and streamflow yield over the
   study period. The simulation also reproduces a conceptual model of
   hillslope infiltration-excess runoff generation linked to downstream
   channel percolation losses that depend on the rainfall event size.
   Model-derived thresholds were obtained for the amount of hillslope
   runoff (6 mm) and rainfall (12.5 mm) necessary for streamflow yield,
   such that 40\% of percolation occurs for small events that do not reach
   the outlet. Using a set of scenarios, we identify that hillslope
   infiltration controls the rainfall threshold necessary to initiate
   percolation, while channel infiltration affects the partitioning into
   percolation and streamflow yield. Thus, the connectivity along
   hillslope-channel pathways is deemed an essential control on the
   streamflow generation and groundwater recharge in arid regions with
   complex terrain.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The Mississippi River and other large rivers have the potential to
   regulate nitrogen export from terrestrial landscapes, and thus mitigate
   eutrophication in downstream aquatic ecosystems. In large rivers,
   human-constructed impoundments and connected backwaters may facilitate
   nitrogen removal; however, the capacity of these features is poorly
   quantified and incompletely incorporated into model frameworks. Using a
   high-resolution and spatially intensive sampling technique, we assessed
   the contribution of individual navigation pools, as well as impounded
   open waters and backwater wetlands within them, to overall nitrate
   retention by mapping the entire length (1370 km) of the Upper
   Mississippi River (UMR) main channel. Based on this single spatial
   survey of water chemistry, the river appeared to act primarily as a
   passive nitrate transporter, retaining only 12.5\% of the incoming load,
   most of which occurred in the upper 150 km of the river, which includes
   the largest and only naturally impounded reach of the river. Although
   reservoirs typically are nitrogen sinks, our data indicate that UMR dams
   do not impede river flows to the extent necessary to promote substantial
   changes in water residence times and subsequent nitrogen removal.
   Backwaters routinely had lower nitrate concentrations than the main
   channel, but their limited hydrologic connectivity to the
   through-flowing river channel constrained their influence on downstream
   export. As a whole, the UMR did not remove a substantial proportion of
   its nitrate load despite optimal N removal conditions, numerous
   impoundments, and the presence of extensive backwater habitats. These
   results suggest that efforts to reduce delivery of nitrogen to the Gulf
   of Mexico should emphasize mitigation strategies that target upland
   nutrient sources rather than relying on removal within the Mississippi
   River.}},

Abstract = {{A recent boom in hydroelectric development in the world's most diverse
   tropical river basins is currently threatening aquatic biodiversity on
   an unprecedented scale. Among the most controversial of these projects
   is the Belo Monte Hydroelectric Complex (BMHC) on the Xingu River, the
   Amazon's largest clear-water tributary. The design of the BMHC creates
   three distinctly altered segments: a flooded section upstream of the
   main dam, a middle section between the dam and the main powerhouse that
   will be dewatered, and a downstream section subject to flow alteration
   from powerhouse discharge. This region of the Xingu is notable for an
   extensive series of rapids known as the Volta Grande that hosts
   exceptional levels of endemic aquatic biodiversity; yet, patterns of
   temporal and spatial variation in community composition within this
   highly threatened habitat are not well documented. We surveyed fish
   assemblages within rapids in the three segments impacted by the BMHC
   prior to hydrologic alteration, and tested for differences in assemblage
   structure between segments and seasons. Fish species richness varied
   only slightly between segments, but there were significant differences
   in assemblage structure between segments and seasons. Most of the
   species thought to be highly dependent on rapids habitat, including
   several species listed as threatened in Brazil, were either restricted
   to or much more abundant within the upstream and middle segments. Our
   analysis identified the middle section of the Volta Grande as critically
   important for the conservation of this diverse, endemic fish fauna.
   Additional research is urgently needed to determine dam operations that
   may optimize energy production with an environmental flow regime that
   conserves the river's unique habitat and biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Depressional wetlands of the extensive U.S. and Canadian Prairie Pothole
   Region afford numerous ecosystem processes that maintain healthy
   watershed functioning. However, these wetlands have been lost at a
   prodigious rate over past decades due to drainage for development,
   climate effects, and other causes. Options for management entities to
   protect the existing wetlands, and their functions, may focus on
   conserving wetlands based on spatial location vis-a-vis a floodplain or
   on size limitations (e.g., permitting smaller wetlands to be destroyed
   but not larger wetlands). Yet the effects of such management practices
   and the concomitant loss of depressional wetlands on watershed-scale
   hydrological, biogeochemical, and ecological functions are largely
   unknown. Using a hydrological model, we analyzed how different loss
   scenarios by wetland size and proximal location to the stream network
   affected watershed storage (i.e., inundation patterns and residence
   times), connectivity (i.e., streamflow contributing areas), and export
   (i.e., streamflow) in a large watershed in the Prairie Pothole Region of
   North Dakota, USA. Depressional wetlands store consequential amounts of
   precipitation and snowmelt. The loss of smaller depressional wetlands
   (<3.0ha) substantially decreased landscape-scale inundation
   heterogeneity, total inundated area, and hydrological residence times.
   Larger wetlands act as hydrologic gatekeepers, preventing surface runoff
   from reaching the stream network, and their modeled loss had a greater
   effect on streamflow due to changes in watershed connectivity and
   storage characteristics of larger wetlands. The wetland management
   scenario based on stream proximity (i.e., protecting wetlands 30 m and
   similar to 450 m from the stream) alone resulted in considerable
   landscape heterogeneity loss and decreased inundated area and residence
   times. With more snowmelt and precipitation available for runoff with
   wetland losses, contributing area increased across all loss scenarios.
   We additionally found that depressional wetlands attenuated peak flows;
   the probability of increased downstream flooding from wetland loss was
   also consistent across all loss scenarios. It is evident from this study
   that optimizing wetland management for one end goal (e.g., protection of
   large depressional wetlands for flood attenuation) over another (e.g.,
   protecting of small depressional wetlands for biodiversity) may come at
   a cost for overall watershed hydrological, biogeochemical, and
   ecological resilience, functioning, and integrity.}},

   congruent patterns in subdivision, and population structure was
   consistent with expectations based on hydrologic connectivity. Within
   the Laurentian Great Lakes, Lake Huron and Lake Ontario were identified

Abstract = {{Cultivated land is a major source of pesticides, which are transported
   with the runoff water and eroded soil during rainfall events and pollute
   riverine and estuarine environments. Common ecotoxicological assessments
   of riverine systems are mainly based on water sampling and analysis of
   only the dissolved phase, and address a single pesticide's toxicological
   impact under laboratory conditions. A clear overview of mixtures of
   pesticides in the adsorbed and dissolved phases is missing, and
   therefore the full ecotoxicological impact is not fully addressed. The
   aim of this study was to characterize and quantify pesticide
   concentrations in both suspended sediment and dissolved phases, to
   provide a better understanding of pesticide-load dynamics during storm
   events in coastal streams in a Mediterranean climate. High-resolution
   sampling campaigns of seven flood events were conducted during two rainy
   seasons in Alexander stream, Israel. Samples of suspended sediments were
   separated from the solution and both media were analyzed separately for
   250 pesticides. A total of 63 pesticides were detected; 18 and 16
   pesticides were found solely in the suspended sediments and solution,
   respectively. Significant differences were observed among the pesticide
   groups: only 7\% of herbicide, 20\% of fungicide and 42\% of insecticide
   load was transported with the suspended sediments. However, in both
   dissolved and adsorbed phases, a mix of pesticides was found which were
   graded from ``mobile{''} to ``non-mobile{''} with varied distribution
   coefficients. Diuron, and tebuconazole were frequently found in large
   quantities in both phases. Whereas insecticide and fungicide transport
   is likely governed by application time and method, the governing factor
   for herbicide load was the magnitude of the stream discharge. The
   results show a complex dynamic of pesticide load affected by excessive
   use of pesticides, which should be taken into consideration when
   designing projects to monitor riverine and estuarine water quality. (c)

Abstract = {{A number of large hydropower dams are currently under development or in
   an advanced stage of planning in the Magdalena River basin, Colombia,
   spelling uncertainty for the Mompos Depression wetlands, one of the
   largest wetland systems in South America at 3400 km(2). Annual
   large-scale inundation of floodplains and their associated wetlands
   regulates water, nutrient, and sediment cycles, which in turn sustain a
   wealth of ecological processes and ecosystem services, including
   critical food supplies. In this study, we implemented an integrated
   approach focused on key attributes of ecologically functional
   floodplains: (1) hydrologic connectivity between the river and the
   floodplain, and between upstream and downstream sections; (2) hydrologic
   variability patterns and their links to local and regional processes;
   and (3) the spatial scale required to sustain floodplain-associated
   processes and benefits, like migratory fish biodiversity. The
   implemented framework provides an explicit quantification of the
   nonlinear or direct response relationship of those considerations with
   hydropower development. The proposed framework was used to develop a
   comparative analysis of the potential effects of the hydropower
   expansion necessary to meet projected 2050 electricity requirements. As
   part of this study, we developed an enhancement of the Water Evaluation
   and Planning system (WEAP) that allows resolution of the floodplains
   water balance at a medium scale (similar to 1000 to 10 000 km(2)) and
   evaluation of the potential impacts of upstream water management
   practices. In the case of the Mompos Depression wetlands, our results
   indicate that the potential additional impacts of new hydropower
   infrastructure with respect to baseline conditions can range up to one
   order of magnitude between scenarios that are comparable in terms of
   energy capacity. Fragmentation of connectivity corridors between lowland
   floodplains and upstream spawning habitats and reduction of sediment
   loads show the greatest impacts, with potential reductions of up to 97.6
   and 80 \%, respectively, from pre-dam conditions. In some development
   scenarios, the amount of water regulated and withheld by upstream
   infrastructure is of similar magnitude to existing fluxes involved in
   the episodic inundation of the floodplain during dry years and, thus,
   can also induce substantial changes in floodplain seasonal dynamics of
   average-to-dry years in some areas of the Mompos Depression.}},

Abstract = {{Riverine biological communities are highly resilient to extreme flood
   and/or drying disturbance regimes that would otherwise be destructive
   because these organisms can recolonise from upstream, floodplain, or
   hyporheic refugia when suitable conditions return. Healthy rivers
   require a high degree of connectivity to support complex life cycles of
   many lotic organisms and associated ecosystem functioning. Similarly,
   connectivity is required for appropriate geophysical functioning;
   permitting flux of water and sediment that drives channel-forming and
   ecological processes. Ecological and geophysical processes have operated
   in this temporal and spatial patchwork of disturbance and recovery
   pre-Anthropocene. Human impacts are increasing constraints on river and
   floodplain connectivity, severing many natural pathways, and degrading
   river ecosystem functioning. River restoration seeks to re-establish
   some of those biological and physical connections to enhance some level
   of system health. However, increasing sediment connectivity may be
   detrimental to river health in some instances. Strongly connected
   catchments can transmit excessive quantities of sediment from
   inappropriate land management, detrimental invasive species can spread
   more widely, and many ecosystem processes can exceed positive feedback
   control. Simply restoring connectivity will not necessarily lead to
   healthy river ecosystems. River management requires a greater
   understanding of how and when connectivity can and should be restored.
   Although current thinking is often that greater connectivity is better,
   we illustrate with examples from New Zealand rivers that this is not
   always the case. The benefits and costs of maintaining or restoring
   river connectivity need to be given as much attention as the restoration
   and maintenance of river systems per se.}},

Title = {{Dissolved Trace and Minor Elements in Cryoconite Holes and Supraglacial
   Streams, Canada Glacier, Antarctica}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{APR 11}},
Abstract = {{We present a synthesis of the trace element chemistry in melt on the
   surface Canada Glacier, Taylor Valley, McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV),
   Antarctica (similar to 78 degrees S). The MDV is largely ice-free. Low
   accumulation rates, strong winds, and proximity to the valley floor make
   these glaciers dusty in comparison to their inland counterparts. This
   study examines both supraglacial melt streams and cryoconite holes.
   Supraglacial streams on the lower Canada Glacier have median dissolved
   (<0.4 mu m) concentrations of Fe, Mn, As, Cu, and V of 71.5, 75.5, 3.7,
   4.6, and 4.3 nM. All dissolved Cd concentrations and the vast majority
   of Pb values are below our analytical detection (i.e., 0.4 and 0.06 nM).
   Chemical behavior did not follow similar trends for eastern and western
   draining waters. Heterogeneity likely reflects distinctions eolian
   deposition, rock:water ratios, and hydrologic connectivity. Future
   increases in wind-delivered sediment will likely drive dynamic responses
   in melt chemistry. For elements above detection limits, dissolved
   concentrations in glacier surface melt are within an order of magnitude
   of concentrations observed in proglacial streams (i.e., flowing on the
   valley floor). The Fe enrichment of cryoconite water relative to N, P,
   or Si exceeds enrichment observed in marine phytoplankton. This suggests
   that the glacier surface is an important source of Fe to downstream
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{A fully integrated, physically-based model of a drained and farmed
   wetland complex in the Prairie Pothole Region of Iowa (termed Ellsworth
   \#2) was developed to investigate hydrologic connectivity of surface and
   groundwater sources. The model is based on the code HydroGeoSphere,
   which solves surface and subsurface flow and the interaction between
   these domains. Physical processes governing the hydrologic response of a
   wetland, precipitation, plant transpiration, and surface and subsurface
   evaporation, were included in the model. The model was run for 6 years
   and predicted water table location was compared against measurements.
   Results indicated that intermittent ponding was observed in pothole
   depressions but hydrologic connectivity among three pothole depressions
   via surface water ponding was rarely established. Extensive subsurface
   tile drainage system simulated in the model removed a substantial volume
   of water and reduced the amount and duration of ponding. Groundwater
   discharge contributed to some degree during nearly all ponding events in
   the pothole depressions as exfiltration ranged from 1.7 to 23.6 \% of
   annual precipitation. Despite simplifications, the model captures the

Abstract = {{Understanding the processes controlling nutrient delivery in headwater

   environmental variables representing the fluvial and wider watershed
   conditions prior to, and during the monitored storm events. Results
   showed the artificial drainage network (i.e., surface tile inlets and
   subsurface tile drains) in these watersheds was the primary flow pathway
   for nutrient delivery to streams, but nutrient behavior and export
   during storm events was regulated by the flow paths to and the intensity
   of the drainage network, the availability of nutrients, and the relative
   contributions of upland and in-stream nutrient sources. Potential
   sources and flow pathways for transport varied among NO3-N, PP, and DRP

Abstract = {{Interest in connectivity has increased in the aquatic sciences, partly
   because of its relevance to the Clean Water Act. This paper has two
   objectives: (1) provide a framework to understand hydrological,
   chemical, and biological connectivity, focusing on how headwater streams
   and wetlands connect to and contribute to rivers; and (2) briefly review
   methods to quantify hydrological and chemical connectivity. Streams and
   wetlands affect river structure and function by altering material and
   biological fluxes to the river; this depends on two factors: (1)
   functions within streams and wetlands that affect material fluxes; and
   (2) connectivity (or isolation) from streams and wetlands to rivers that
   allows (or prevents) material transport between systems. Connectivity
   can be described in terms of frequency, magnitude, duration, timing, and
   rate of change. It results from physical characteristics of a system,
   e.g., climate, soils, geology, topography, and the spatial distribution
   of aquatic components. Biological connectivity is also affected by
   traits and behavior of the biota. Connectivity can be altered by human
   impacts, often in complex ways. Because of variability in these factors,
   connectivity is not constant but varies over time and space.
   Connectivity can be quantified with field-based methods, modeling, and
   remote sensing. Further studies using these methods are needed to
   classify and quantify connectivity of aquatic ecosystems and to
   understand how impacts affect connectivity.}},

Abstract = {{Streams, riparian areas, floodplains, alluvial aquifers, and downstream
   waters (e.g., large rivers, lakes, and oceans) are interconnected by
   longitudinal, lateral, and vertical fluxes of water, other materials,
   and energy. Collectively, these interconnected waters are called fluvial
   hydrosystems. Physical and chemical connectivity within fluvial
   hydrosystems is created by the transport of nonliving materials (e.g.,
   water, sediment, nutrients, and contaminants) which either do or do not
   chemically change (chemical and physical connections, respectively). A
   substantial body of evidence unequivocally demonstrates physical and
   chemical connectivity between streams and riparian wetlands and
   downstream waters. Streams and riparian wetlands are structurally
   connected to downstream waters through the network of continuous
   channels and floodplain form that make these systems physically
   contiguous, and the very existence of these structures provides strong
   geomorphologic evidence for connectivity. Functional connections between
   streams and riparian wetlands and their downstream waters vary
   geographically and over time, based on proximity, relative size,
   environmental setting, material disparity, and intervening units.
   Because of the complexity and dynamic nature of connections among

Abstract = {{Ephemeral and intermittent streams are abundant in the arid and semiarid
   landscapes of the Western and Southwestern United States (U.S.).
   Connectivity of ephemeral and intermittent streams to the relatively few
   perennial reaches through runoff is a major driver of the ecohydrology
   of the region. These streams supply water, sediment, nutrients, and
   biota to downstream reaches and rivers. In addition, they provide runoff
   to recharge alluvial and regional groundwater aquifers that support
   baseflow in perennial mainstem stream reaches over extended periods when
   little or no precipitation occurs. Episodic runoff, as well as
   groundwater inflow to surface water in streams support limited naturally
   occurring riparian communities. This paper provides an overview and
   comprehensive examination of factors affecting the hydrologic, chemical,
   and ecological connectivity of ephemeral and intermittent streams on
   perennial or intermittent rivers in the arid and semiarid Southwestern
   U.S. Connectivity as influenced and moderated through the physical
   landscape, climate, and human impacts to downstream waters or rivers is
   presented first at the broader Southwestern scale, and secondly drawing
   on a specific and more detailed example of the San Pedro Basin due to
   its history of extensive observations and research in the basin. A wide

Abstract = {{Since the 1880s, hydrological modification of the Greater Florida
   Everglades has reduced water levels and flows in Everglades National
   Park (ENP). The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Program (CERP)
   began in 2000 to restore pre-drainage flows and preserve the natural
   landscape of the Everglades. However, sea-level rise (SLR) was not
   considered in the development of CERP. We used long-term data
   (2001-2016) from the Florida Coastal Everglades-Long Term Ecological
   Research Program to quantify and model the spatial dynamics of water
   levels, salinity, and nutrients in response to changes in climate,
   freshwater management and SLR in the Shark River Slough (SRS), ENP.
   Results indicate that fresh-to-marine head difference (FMHD) was the
   single most important factor affecting marine-to-freshwater hydrologic
   connectivity and transport of salinity and phosphorous upstream from the
   Gulf of Mexico. Sea-level has increasingly exceeded ground surface
   elevation at the most downstream freshwater site in SRS, thereby
   reducing the FMHD. We showed a higher impact of SLR in the dry season
   when there was practically no freshwater inflow to raise FMHD. We also
   demonstrated effectiveness of inflow depends more on the monthly
   distribution than the total annual volume. Hence, the impact per unit
   volume of inflow is significantly higher in the dry season in preventing
   high salinity and marine-derived nutrient levels. We advocate that FMHD
   needs to be factored into water management decisions to reduce adverse
   and likely irreversible effects of SLR throughout the Everglades

Abstract = {{In aquatic ecosystems, tributaries play an important role in maintaining
   the populations and diversity of aquatic organisms throughout the
   drainage basin, but because of their small catchments, these ecosystems
   are often more susceptible to the effect of land-use changes and
   flow-regime alterations. Here, we examined anthropogenic effects on
   benthic macroinvertebrate diversity in the tributary lagoons,
   collectively called ``Naiko,{''} surrounding Lake Biwa. We sampled
   macroinvertebrates and determined the environmental characteristics of
   20 tributary lagoons. We identified the environmental factors
   determining the diversity of macroinvertebrates and found that turbidity
   significantly diminished species diversity. We assessed the
   anthropogenic stressors that contributed to the increase in turbidity
   and found that human population density and the proportion of paddy
   fields in the watershed area were positively correlated with turbidity,
   most likely caused by erosion of terrigenous organic matter from the
   paddy fields and urban areas. In addition, the presence of sluice gates
   and the lengths of channels connecting to the main lake were positively
   correlated with turbidity, suggesting that these factors lowered
   hydrologic connectivity and retained organic matter. We concluded that
   changes to the landscape and decreased hydrologic connectivity caused by
   human activity increased turbidity, which in turn decreased
   macroinvertebrate diversity. The identification of these factors in
   tributaries is vital for developing a strategy for habitat restoration
   to conserve the entire ecosystem of the Lake Biwa basin.}},

Abstract = {{While the concept of connectivity has gained popularity in fields like
   hydrology and ecology, little agreement exists on its definition, which
   hinders its use in both scientific and legal contexts. In contrast,
   neuroscientists have developed not only strong conceptualizations of
   connectivity but also tools to quantify it: a clear distinction is made
   between structural connectivity, which is determined from brain anatomy;
   functional connectivity, which is estimated based on statistical
   dependencies between neuronal electric timeseries; and effective
   connectivity, which infers causal relations from the same timeseries
   based on the assumption that ``true{''} interactions occur with a
   certain time delay. The motivation of this review arose from the
   hypothesis that connectivity related statistical techniques, which are
   applied to timeseries of electrical currents measured by placing
   electrodes on the scalp of the human brain, could also apply to
   high-frequency hydrological timeseries acquired to characterize
   catchment response to precipitation. Here we bring together existing
   conceptualizations of structural, functional and effective connectivity
   in hydrology and ecology and compare them with those used in brain
   neuroscience. We then summarize the most important brain connectivity
   measures and their associated mathematical frameworks before evaluating
   the potential of those measures to help advance our understanding of
   hydrologic connectivity properties-in terms of the frequency, magnitude,
   timing, duration and rate of water movement linking two disparate
   locations. Lastly, we present a short case study where a selection of
   brain connectivity measures is applied to 35 groundwater and streamflow
   timeseries from a Swiss catchment to infer subsurface flow-driven
   hydrologic connectivity. Our literature review combined with our short
   case study suggest that an ensemble of functional and effective
   connectivity measures should be used and constrained not only by
   structural connectivity measures but also by interpretation thresholds
   in order to make results parsimonious. We highlight challenges
   associated with transferring brain connectivity measures to hydrology,
   especially those related to choosing the appropriate length and sampling
   frequency of input timeseries when assessing perennial versus ephemeral
   connectivity, appropriately detecting and differentiating noisy from
   indirect connections, and interpreting unbounded connectivity measures.
   We then offer recommendations for future research and propose that
   hydrologists use a common classification system encompassing all
   potential connectivity assessment approaches and measures in order to
   facilitate scientific communication.}},

Abstract = {{Watersheds are three-dimensional hydrologic systems where the
   longitudinal expansion/contraction of stream networks, vertical
   connection/disconnection between shallow and deep groundwater systems,
   and lateral connectivity of these water sources to streams mediate
   runoff production and nutrient export. The connectivity of runoff source
   areas during both baseflow and stormflow conditions and their combined
   influence on biogeochemical fluxes remain poorly understood. Here we
   focused on a set of 3.3 and 48.4 ha nested watersheds (North Carolina,
   USA). These watersheds comprise ephemeral and intermittent
   runoff-producing headwaters and perennial runoff-producing lowlands.
   Within these landscape elements, we characterized the timing and
   magnitude of precipitation, runoff, and runoff-generating flow paths.
   The active surface drainage network (ASDN) reflected connectivity to,
   and contributions from, source areas that differed under baseflow and
   stormflow conditions. The baseflow-associated ASDN expanded and
   contracted seasonally, driven by the rise and fall of the seasonal water
   table. Superimposed on this were event-activated source area
   contributions driven by connectivity to surficial and shallow subsurface
   flow paths. Frequently activated shallow flow paths also caused
   increased in-stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations with
   increases in runoff across both watershed scales. The spread and
   variability within this DOC-runoff relationship was driven by a seasonal
   depletion of DOC from continual shallow subsurface flow path activation
   and subsequent replenishment from autumn litterfall. Our findings
   suggest that hydrobiogeochemical signals at larger watershed outlets can
   be driven by the expansion, contraction, and connection of lateral,
   longitudinal, and vertical source areas with distinct runoff generation
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{The real-time monitoring of hydrodynamics in wetlands at fine spatial
   and temporal scales is crucial for understanding ecological and
   hydrological processes. The key interest of light detection and ranging
   (LiDAR) data is its ability to accurately detect microtopography.
   However, how such data may account for subtle wetland flooding changes
   in both space and time still needs to be tested, even though the degree
   to which these changes impact biodiversity patterns is of upmost
   importance. This study assesses the use of 1 m x 1 m resolution aerial
   LiDAR data in combination with in situ piezometric measurements in order
   to predict the flooded areas at a daily scale along a one-year
   hydrological period. The simulation was applied over 663 ha of wet
   grasslands distributed on six sites across the Marais Poitevin (France).
   A set of seven remote sensing images was used as the reference data in
   order to validate the simulation and provide a high overall accuracy
   (76-94\%). The best results were observed in areas where the ditch
   density was low, whereas the highly drained sites showed a discrepancy
   with the predicted flooded areas. The landscape proportion index was
   calculated for the daily steps. The results highlighted the
   spatiotemporal dynamics of the shallow flooded areas. We showed that the
   differences in the flooding durations among the years were mainly
   related to a narrow contrast in topography (40 cm), and occurred over a
   short period of time (two months).}},

Abstract = {{Kettle holes are glacially created ponds that form within landscape
   depressions and are numerous across young moraine landscapes. Kettle
   hole water budgets are based primarily on winter precipitation, and
   therefore, undergo pronounced short-term changes in water level
   fluctuations. Little is known about kettle hole sediment biogeochemistry
   in NE Germany, especially with regards to hydroperiod. Our objective for
   this study was to link the abiotic influences demarked by the
   evaporative isotopic signal from kettle hole water and solute chemistry
   to sediment organic matter turnover imprinted in the sediment C-13 and
   N-15 isotopic values. From the 20 kettle holes we sampled, 19 of these
   completely dried out, but on different dates. This dynamic was partially
   explained by longitudinal and elevational changes over the catchment
   area illustrating regional controls of kettle hole water balance. At the
   scale of an individual kettle hole, we estimated evaporation explained
   up to 38\% of water volume loss. The changes in water levels were weakly
   related to differences in surface sediment elemental N and C
   concentrations between kettle hole edge and centre positions. These
   dynamics were primarily driven by redox conditions, Ca2+, and several
   nutrient concentrations (dissolved organic carbon, total dissolved
   nitrogen, total dissolved P, and ammonium) in the water column. Although
   we did not detect differences in the surface sediment C-13 and N-15
   values, the N-15 signature in relation to the C:N ratio highlights the
   advanced decomposition state of surface sediment OM in temporarily water
   filled kettle holes.}},

Abstract = {{Freshwater ecosystems across the Amazon are largely comprised of small
   streams and headwaters of riparian zones. These areas are legally
   protected within private landholdings in Brazil, but recent changes in
   the environmental legislation have slackened protection requirements,
   with unpredictable consequences to the integrity and functioning of
   these freshwater environments. Local drivers of riparian forest loss and
   degradation should be understood by considering context-dependent land
   management practices and pressures within a region. Here, we examine the
   spatial determinants of the total amount and spectral quality of both
   headwater and overall riparian forests within private landholdings
   within a highly fragmented region of southern Amazonia. We built
   generalized linear models to assess how the amount and spectral quality
   of headwater and riparian forests respond to landholding size and
   distance to roads and an urban center, and document landholder
   compliance rates according to both the current and previous Brazilian
   environmental legislation. Although forest loss and degradation are
   typically associated, forest degradation responded independently to the
   same drivers. Headwater forests were generally more degraded than
   riparian forests, and smallholders complied less often with legal
   requirements than largeholders. Proximity to roads and the nearest town
   had a detrimental effect on both headwater and riparian forest amount
   and quality, and distance to the nearest town affected all variables,
   except for headwater forest quality. Compliance with environmental
   legislation is the first step in protecting riparian and headwater
   forests, but alternative landscape management strategies must be
   explored, particularly focusing on smallholdings, which are most
   vulnerable to deforestation and forest degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Geographically isolated wetlands, those entirely surrounded by uplands,
   provide numerous landscape-scale ecological functions, many of which are
   dependent on the degree to which they are hydrologically connected to
   nearby waters. There is a growing need for field-validated,
   landscape-scale approaches for classifying wetlands on the basis of
   their expected degree of hydrologic connectivity with stream networks.
   This study quantified seasonal variability in surface hydrologic
   connectivity (SHC) patterns between forested Delmarva bay wetland
   complexes and perennial/ intermittent streams at 23 sites over a
   full-water year (2014-2015). Field data were used to develop metrics to
   predict SHC using hypothesized landscape drivers of connectivity
   duration and timing. Connection duration was most strongly related to
   the number and area of wetlands within wetland complexes as well as the
   channel width of the temporary stream connecting the wetland complex to
   a perennial/ intermittent stream. Timing of SHC onset was related to the
   topographic wetness index and drainage density within the catchment.
   Stepwise regression modelling found that landscape metrics could be used
   to predict SHC duration as a function of wetland complex catchment area,
   wetland area, wetland number, and soil available water storage (adj-R-2
   = 0.74, p <.0001). Results may be applicable to assessments of forested
   depressional wetlands elsewhere in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and
   Southeastern Coastal Plain, where climate, landscapes, and hydrological
   inputs and losses are expected to be similar to the study area.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater discharges in the western Canadian oil sands region impact
   river water quality. Mapping groundwater discharges to rivers in the oil
   sands region is important to target water quality monitoring efforts and
   to ensure injected wastewater and steam remain sequestered rather than
   eventually resurfacing. Saline springs composed of Pleistocene-aged
   glacial meltwater exist in the region, but their spatial distribution
   has not been mapped comprehensively. Here we show that formation waters
   discharge into 3 major rivers as they flow through the Athabasca Oil
   Sands Region adjacent to many active oil sands projects. These
   discharges increase river chloride concentrations from river headwaters
   to downstream reaches by factors of similar to 23 in the Christina
   River, similar to 4 in the Clearwater River, and similar to 5 in the
   Athabasca River. Our survey provides further evidence for the
   substantial impact of formation water discharges on river water quality,
   even though they comprise less than similar to 2\% of total streamflow.
   Geochemical evidence supporting formation water discharges as the
   leading control on river salinity include increases in river chloride
   concentrations, Na/(Na + Ca) ratios, Cl/(Cl + SO4) ratios and decreases
   in Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios; each mixing trend is consistent with saline
   groundwater discharges sourced from Cretaceous or Devonian aquifers.
   These regional subsurface-to-surface connections signify that injected
   wastewater or steam may potentially resurface in the future, emphasizing
   the critical importance of mapping groundwater flow paths to understand
   present-day streamflow quality and to predict the potential for injected

Abstract = {{Watershed integrity is the capacity of a watershed to support and
   maintain the full range of ecological processes and functions essential
   to sustainability. Using information from EPA's StreamCat dataset, we
   calculated and mapped an Index of Watershed Integrity (IWI) for 2.6
   million watersheds in the conterminous US with first-order
   approximations of relationships between stressors and six watershed
   functions: hydrologic regulation, regulation of water chemistry,
   sediment regulation, hydrologic connectivity, temperature regulation,
   and habitat provision. Results show high integrity in the western US,
   intermediate integrity in the southern and eastern US, and the lowest
   integrity in the temperate plains and lower Mississippi Valley.
   Correlation between the six functional components was high (r =
   0.85-0.98). A related Index of Catchment Integrity (ICI) was developed
   using local drainages of individual stream segments (i.e., excluding
   upstream information). We evaluated the ability of the IWI and ICI to
   predict six continuous site-level indicators with regression analyses
   three biological indicators and principal components derived from water
   quality, habitat, and combined water quality and habitat variables using
   data from EPA's National Rivers and Streams Assessment. Relationships
   were highly significant, but the IWI only accounted for 1-12\% of the
   variation in the four biological and habitat variables. The IWI
   accounted for over 25\% of the variation in the water quality and
   combined principal components nationally, and 32-39\% in the Northern
   and Southern Appalachians. We also used multinomial logistic regression
   to compare the IWI with the categorical forms of the three biological
   indicators. Results were consistent: we found positive associations but
   modest results. We compared how the IWI and ICI predicted the water
   quality PC relative to agricultural and urban land use. The IWI or ICI
   are the best predictors of the water quality PC for the CONUS and six of
   the nine ecoregions, but they only perform marginally better than
   agriculture in most instances. However, results suggest that agriculture
   would not be appropriate in all parts of the country, and the index is
   meant to be responsive to all stressors. The IWI in its present form
   (available through the StreamCat website;
   https://www.cpa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/streamcat) could
   be useful for management efforts at multiple scales, especially when
   combined with information on site condition. The IWI could be improved
   by incorporating empirical or literature-derived relationships between
   functional components and stressors. However, limitations concerning the
   absence of data for certain stressors should be considered.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of connectivity has been the subject of a great deal of
   recent research and provided new insights and breakthroughs on runoff
   generation processes and watershed biogeochemistry. However, a consensus
   definition and cohesive mathematical framework that would permit the
   consistent quantification of hydrologic connectivity, the examination of
   the interrelationships between water and material (e.g., sediment and
   chemicals) connectivity, or rigorous study intercomparison, have not

   conceptualizations and site-specific or process-specific metrics, this
   paper aimed to review the current state of science on hydrologic
   connectivity and its role in water-mediated connectivity of material
   such as solutes and sediment before introducing a conceptual and a
   mathematical connectivity assessment framework. These frameworks rely on
   the quantification of Time scales, Thresholds, Excesses and Losses
   related to water and water-mediated material transport dynamics and are
   referred to as the T-TEL method. Through a small case study, we show how
   the T-TEL method allows a wide range of properties to be quantified,
   namely the occurrence, frequency, duration, magnitude, and spatial
   extent of water and water-mediated material connectivity. We also
   propose a research agenda to refine the T-TEL method and ensure its

Abstract = {{Understanding hydrologic connectivity between wetlands and perennial
   streams is critical to understanding the reliance of stream flow on
   inputs from wetlands. We used the isotopic evaporation signal in water
   and remote sensing to examine wetland-stream hydrologic connectivity
   within the Pipestem Creek watershed, North Dakota, a watershed dominated
   by prairie-pothole wetlands. Pipestem Creek exhibited an
   evaporated-water signal that had approximately half the
   isotopic-enrichment signal found in most evaporatively enriched
   prairie-pothole wetlands. Groundwater adjacent to Pipestem Creek had
   isotopic values that indicated recharge from winter precipitation and
   had no significant evaporative enrichment, indicating that enriched
   surface water did not contribute significantly to groundwater
   discharging into Pipestem Creek. The estimated surface water area
   necessary to generate the evaporation signal within Pipestem Creek was
   highly dynamic, varied primarily with the amount of discharge, and was
   typically greater than the immediate Pipestem Creek surface water area,
   indicating that surficial flow from wetlands contributed to stream flow
   throughout the summer. We propose a dynamic range of spilling thresholds
   for prairie-pothole wetlands across the watershed allowing for wetland
   inputs even during low-flow periods. Combining Landsat estimates with
   the isotopic approach allowed determination of potential (Landsat) and
   actual (isotope) contributing areas in wetland-dominated systems. This
   combined approach can give insights into the changes in location and
   magnitude of surface water and groundwater pathways over time. This
   approach can be used in other areas where evaporation from wetlands
   results in a sufficient evaporative isotopic signal.
   Plain Language Summary Connectivity of wetlands within watersheds is
   critical to wetland function at local-to-landscape scales. However,
   actual measures of connectivity between wetlands and streams at the
   watershed scale are difficult to make, but critical for quantifying
   these functions, and for supporting policy and decision making. In this
   manuscript, we combine and compare direct field measurements of
   connectivity using stable isotopes of water, and remotely sensed
   measurements of connectivity using Landsat data. We found that
   prairie-pothole wetlands contributed significant amounts of water to the
   perennial stream from high to low-flow conditions. This wetland water
   flowed through surface water connections and not through groundwater
   flow paths. Hydrologic connectivity between prairie-pothole wetlands and
   the stream was dynamic, fluctuating with streamflow. Combining the
   isotopic and Landsat approaches to estimating contributing area appears
   to be a promising technique for determining potential and actual
   contributing areas in these flat wetland-dominated systems.}},

Abstract = {{Thaw lakes are ubiquitous on arctic coastal plains (ACPs). While many
   thaw lakes have steep banks, stable water levels, and static surface
   areas, others only partially fill their basins and vary in area over the
   summer. These partially drained lakes (PDLs) are hydrologically
   connected to the wetlands immediately surrounding them. Heat and
   nutrient availability limit aquatic productivity on ACPs, and we
   hypothesized that shallow shorelines and greater hydrologic connectivity
   with the landscape should result in greater nutrient concentrations and
   biogeochemical cycling in PDLs. We tested this by monitoring water
   chemistry in lakes with varying levels of seasonal drainage in sandy and
   silty peaty lowland sites on the ACP of Alaska. One highly drained lake
   (N1) was significantly warmer than minimally drained lakes (minDLs)
   related to earlier ice off, reaching temperatures as high as 16 degrees
   C in June when minDLs still contained ice. Ammonia, total dissolved
   phosphorus, and dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations
   were higher in lakes with greater drainage, and concentrations in N1
   rivaled those in the small, biologically productive ponds. Many PDLs
   displayed a midsummer decrease in nutrients consistent with assimilation
   by the aquatic ecosystem, and a late-summer increase most likely related
   to runoff from drained lake margins following precipitation. N1 exported
   kilograms of ammonium and total dissolved phosphorus to the stream
   network over the summer. Given increased warming and drying in the
   arctic, the proportion of PDLs may be changing, which in turn may affect
   nutrient and organic matter availability in arctic lakes and export to
   downstream environments.}},

   variable, influences spatial modeling outcomes. We selected ten
   watersheds in the USA and analyzed if water quality variables with
   higher Moran's I values undergo greater increases in the coefficient of
   determination (R-2) and greater decreases in residual SAC (rSAC). We
   compared non-spatial ordinary least squares to two spatial regression
   approaches, namely, spatial lag and error models. The predictors were
   the principal components of topographic, land cover, and soil group
   variables. The results revealed that water quality variables with higher
   inherent SAC showed more substantial increases in R-2 and decreases in
   rSAC after performing spatial regressions. In this study, we found a
   generally linear relationship between the spatial model outcomes (R-2
   and rSAC) and the degree of SAC in each water quality variable. We
   suggest that the inherent level of SAC in response variables can predict
   improvements in models before spatial regression is performed.}},

Abstract = {{An improved understanding of ecohydrologic connections is critical for
   improving land management decisions in water-scarce regions of the
   western United States. For this study, conducted in a semiarid (358 mm)
   rangeland location in central Oregon, we evaluated
   precipitation-interception-soil moisture dynamics at the plot scale and
   characterized surface water and groundwater relations across the
   landscape including areas with and without western juniper (Juniperus
   occidentalis). Results from this study show that juniper woodlands
   intercepted up to 46\% of total precipitation, altering soil moisture
   distribution under the canopy and in the interspace. Results indicate
   that precipitation reaching the ground can rapidly percolate through the
   soil profile and into the shallow aquifer, and that strong hydrologic
   connections between surface and groundwater components exist during
   winter precipitation and snowmelt runoff seasons. Greater streamflow and
   springflow rates were observed in the treated watershed when compared to
   the untreated. Streamflow rates up to 1020 L min(-1) and springflow
   rates peaking 190 L min(-1) were observed in the watershed where juniper
   was removed 13 years ago. In the untreated watershed, streamflow rates
   peaked at 687 L min(-1) and springflow rates peaked at 110 L min(-1).
   Results contribute to improved natural resource management through a
   better understanding of the biophysical connections occurring in
   rangeland ecosystems and the role that woody vegetation encroachment may
   have on altering the hydrology of the site.}},

Abstract = {{The floodplain geomorphology of large lowland rivers is intricately
   related to aquatic ecosystems dependent upon flood pulse dynamics. The
   alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula) is native to the Lower Mississippi
   River and dependent upon floodplain backwater areas for spawning. In
   this study we utilize a geospatial approach to develop a habitat
   suitability index for alligator gar that explicitly considers hydrologic
   connectivity and the floodplain geomorphology along a frequently
   inundated segment of the Lower Mississippi River. The data sets include
   Landsat imagery, a high-resolution LiDAR digital elevation model (DEM),
   National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), and hydrologic and geomorphic data.
   A habitat suitability index is created based on the extent and frequency
   of inundation, water depth, temperature, and vegetation. A comparison
   between the remote sensing approach and the NHD revealed substantial
   differences in the area and location of water bodies available for
   alligator gar spawning. The final habitat suitability index indicates
   that a modest proportion (19\%) of the overall embanked floodplain is
   available for alligator gar spawning. Opportunities exist for management
   efforts to utilize engineered and natural geomorphic features to
   facilitate hydrologic connectivity at flow levels below flood stage that
   would expand the habitat of alligator gar across the floodplain. The
   study results have direct implications regarding environmental
   restoration of the Lower Mississippi, an iconic example of an embanked
   meandering river floodplain. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta (CGSM) is one of the world's most
   productive tropical wetlands and one that has witnessed some of the
   greatest recorded dieback of mangroves. Human-driven loss of hydrologic
   connectivity by roads, artificial channels and water flow regulation
   appears to be the reason behind mangrove mortality in this ungauged
   wetland. In this study, we determined the CGSM's current state of
   hydrologic connectivity by combining a remote sensing technique, termed
   as Wetland Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), with a
   hydrologic study of river water discharge. For this research, we
   processed 29 ALOS-PALSAR acquisitions taken during the period 2007-2011
   and generated 66 interferograms that provide information on relative
   surface water level changes. We found that change in water discharge
   upstream on the main tributary of the CGSM could explain at most 17\% of
   the variance of the change in water level in the CGSM. Fresh water
   inputs into the wetland were identified only when the mean daily water
   discharge in the river exceeded 700m(3) s(-1), which corresponds to only
   30\% of the days during the period. The interferogram analysis also
   revealed that artificial channels within the wetland serve as barriers
   to water flow and contribute to the overall loss in hydrologic
   connectivity. We recommend increasing fresh water inputs from the
   Magdalena River by reducing water regulation of fresh water from the
   river and improving connectivity on either side of the artificial
   channels crossing the CGSM. This study emphasizes the potential of the
   application of wetland InSAR to determine hydrologic connectivity in
   wetlands that are completely or poorly ungauged and to define the
   necessary guidelines for wetland hydrologic restoration.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, hydrologic modifications such as ditching and subsurface
   drainage have significantly reduced wetland water storage capacity
   (i.e., volume of surface water a wetland can retain) and consequent
   wetland functions. While wetland area has been well documented across
   many landscapes and used to guide restoration efforts, few studies have
   directly quantified the associated wetland storage capacity. Here, we
   present a novel raster-based approach to quantify both contemporary and
   potential (i.e., restorable) storage capacities of individual
   depressional basins across landscapes. We demonstrate the utility of
   this method by applying it to the Delmarva Peninsula, a region
   punctuated by both depressional wetlands and drainage ditches. Across
   the entire peninsula, we estimated that restoration (i.e., plugging
   ditches) could increase storage capacity by 80\%. Focusing on an
   individual watershed, we found that over 59\% of restorable storage
   capacity occurs within 20m of the drainage network, and that 93\% occurs
   within 1m elevation of the drainage network. Our demonstration
   highlights widespread ditching in this landscape, spatial patterns of
   both contemporary and potential storage capacities, and clear
   opportunities for hydrologic restoration. In Delmarva and more broadly,
   our novel approach can inform targeted landscape-scale conservation and
   restoration efforts to optimize hydrologically mediated wetland

Abstract = {{We investigated spatial and seasonal variation of fish assemblages of
   Cano Maraca, a creek in Venezuela's Western Llanos, a region with strong
   wet-dry seasonality. Fishes were surveyed over a 19-year period at three
   sites along the longitudinal gradient: a headwater site with a narrow
   channel, a middle site with shallow channels traversing a seasonal
   wetland, and a lower site where the channel has higher banks. Assemblage
   composition and presence of species with juveniles and various life
   history strategies were compared during wet and dry seasons. Overall,
   fish species richness was lowest at the headwater site and highest at
   the downstream site. During the wet season, however, species richness is
   greatest at the middle site, a pattern associated with migration into
   the site for reproduction and use of the wetland as a nursery. During
   the dry season, species richness is greater at the downstream site where
   habitat quality is sufficient to provide suitable habitat for many
   species. Fish movements and population dynamics in Cano Maraca respond
   to seasonal environmental changes, and the fish metacommunity appears
   influenced by species sorting (habitat selection), mass effects
   (source-sink dynamics), patch dynamics (interspecific differences in
   colonization and species interaction) as well as random factors
   (dry-season strandings).}},

Abstract = {{Lateral hydrologic connectivity between a river and its floodplain is
   important for exchanges of organisms and materials that support healthy,

   durations for fish migrating from a mainstem river channel to ten
   different floodplain lakes during a range of discharge magnitudes. We
   modeled routes of movement and fish swim times for five discharges that
   ranged from 140 to 1585 m(3) s(-1) and represented a gradient of
   hydrologic connectivity. Hydrologic travel pathways included perennial
   floodplain channels (tributaries and permanent lakes) and intermittently
   active floodplain channels (channels re-occupying abandoned meander
   segments, meander-scrolls, batture channels, and crevasses). The
   different hydrologic pathways made available during the different
   discharge magnitudes were represented using spatially-variable,
   raster-based cost surfaces. Fish swim times and route of movement varied
   with discharge magnitude and lake location. Two distinct patterns
   emerged between the fish swim times and routes of movement. One group of
   five floodplain lakes experienced very little change in the route or
   rate of fish movement with increasing discharge, while another group of
   five lakes exhibited significant decreases in swim time with increasing

Abstract = {{Mine reclamation requires the reconstruction of entire landforms and
   drainage systems. The hydrological regime of reclaimed landscapes will
   be a manifestation of the processes operating within the individual
   landforms that comprise it. Hydrology is the most important process
   regulating wetland function and development, via strong controls on
   chemical and biotic processes. Accordingly, this research addresses the
   growing and immediate need to understand the hydrological processes that
   operate within reconstructed landscapes following resource extraction.
   In this study, the function of a constructed fenwatershed the Nikanotee
   Fen watershed) is evaluated for the first two years following
   construction 2013-2014) and is assessed and discussed within the context
   of the construction-level design. The system design was capable of
   sustaining wet conditions within the Nikanotee Fen during the snow-free
   period in 2013 and 2014, with persistent ponded water in some areas.
   Evapotranspiration dominated the water fluxes from the system. These
   losses were partially offset by groundwater discharge from the upland
   aquifer, which demonstrated strong hydrologic connectivity with the fen
   in spite of most construction materials having lower than targeted
   saturated hydraulic conductivities. However, the variable surface
   infiltration rates and thick placement of a soil-capping layer
   constrained recharge to the upland aquifer, which remained below
   designed water contents in much of the upland. These findings indicate
   that it is possible to engineer the landscape to accommodate the
   hydrological functions of a fen peatland following surface oil sands
   extraction. Future research priorities should include understanding the
   storage and release of waterwithin coarse-grained reclaimed landforms as
   well as evaluating the relative importance of external water sources and
   internal water conservation mechanisms for the viability of fen
   ecosystems over the longer-term. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentration and quality were examined
   from Arctic lakes located in three clusters across south-west (SW)
   Greenland, covering the regional climatic gradient: cool, wet coastal
   zone; dry inland interior; and cool, dry ice-marginal areas. We
   hypothesized that differences in mean annual precipitation between sites
   would result in a reduced hydrological connectivity between lakes and
   their catchments and that this concentrates degraded DOM. The DOM in the
   inland lake group was characterized by a lower aromaticity and molecular
   weight, a low soil-like fluorescence, and carbon stable isotope (delta
   C-13-DOC) values enriched by similar to 2\% relative to the coastal
   group. DOC-specific absorbance (SUVA(254)) and DOC-specific soil-like
   fluorescence (SUVFC1) revealed seasonal and climatic gradients across
   which DOM exhibited a dynamic we term ``pulse-process{''}: Pulses of DOM
   exported from soils to lakes during snow and ice melt were followed by
   pulses of autochthonous DOM inputs (possibly from macrophytes), and
   their subsequent photochemical and microbial processing. These effects
   regulated the dynamics of DOM in the inland lakes and suggested that if
   circumpolar lakes currently situated in cool wetter climatic regimes
   with strong hydrological connectivity have reduced connectivity under a
   drier future climate, they may evolve toward an end-point of large
   stocks of highly degraded DOC, equivalent to the inland lakes in the
   present study. The regional climatic gradient across SW Greenland and
   its influence on DOM properties in these lakes provide a model of
   possible future changes to lake C cycling in high-latitude systems where
   climatic changes are most pronounced.
   Plain Language Summary Arctic regions are currently experiencing change
   due to warming climate, and Arctic lakes are natural recorders of this
   change. We conducted a study of 20 Arctic lakes situated across a
   climatic gradient in southwest Greenland ranging from cool and wet
   coastal region to a warm and dry inland region. We found that Arctic
   carbon cycles are responding to this change by concentrating dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC), a collection of molecules that form the basis of
   lake food webs, which may be very old and represent long-term
   accumulation of carbon in these lake waters. We suspect that the force
   driving this change is a loss of the connectivity between these lakes
   and their watersheds. Under this scenario, lakes receive less organic
   carbon from soils in their surrounding watersheds and perhaps more from
   fringing aquatic plants. Moreover, earlier loss of lake ice may lead to
   longer open water periods and the chance for sunlight to convert DOC to
   carbon dioxide, representing a feedback to regional climate. As global
   change influences the Arctic broadly, modifications to the hydrologic
   connectivity of lakes to their watersheds may have important
   implications for Arctic inland C cycling.}},

Abstract = {{In the organic-rich environments of peatlands and peaty riparian zones,
   dissolved organic matter (DOM) can act as a carrier for major and trace
   elements. However, the mobilization and export patterns of elements from
   these systems are largely unknown. This study elucidates the annual and
   short-term event-based dynamics of major and trace element
   concentrations in a headwater stream draining an ombrotrophic peatland
   and a peaty riparian zone. Elements are expected to exhibit specific
   export patterns depending on their biogeochemical reactivity and source
   area. We hypothesize that most elements are released during organic
   matter decomposition and are co-transported with DOM in the bog
   catchment, whereas in the riparian zone, other element pools, such as
   shallow groundwater, also play a major role.
   Most of the variance in the data, as revealed by Principal Component
   Analysis, integrated the DOM concentration pattern (element loadings >
   0.8: Al, Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, Zn, Li, Co, As, Sr, Cd, Pb, and DOC). Ca, Mg
   and Sr were also found to load on this principal component, suggesting
   that the main control on element mobilization is not DOM, but rather
   similar source areas and mobilization processes. The DOM-related export
   was driven by plant uptake, plant decomposition and the bog water level
   in terms of hydrologic connectivity. The differences between the bog and
   the riparian zone were mainly driven by different hydrologic conditions
   and additional elemental sources, such as mineral weathering. The export
   patterns of Rb, Cs, K, NO3- and SO42- were predominantly controlled by
   the season and plant uptake, and they were particularly exported by a
   surficial fast flow path. In addition to other elements, Ga, Y and Ba
   were enriched in the upper peat and organic soil layer, likely due to
   anthropogenic pollution. The specific export pattern of these latter
   elements indicates their predominant mobilization by the dissolution of
   dust particles and their subsequent mobilization by coupling to DOM.}},

Abstract = {{The Chicago Area Waterways System (CAWS), an artificial connection
   between Lake Michigan (LMI) and the Illinois River watershed, has served
   as a conduit for invasive species and is a potential pathway for viral
   hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) to spread from the Great Lakes into the
   Illinois River drainage. Although some fishes are known to have moved
   from LMI into the Illinois River via the CAWS, the rate of fish passage
   from the lake into the CAWS is unclear. Stable carbon isotopic
   signatures (C-13) in otoliths differ between lake- and CAWS-resident
   fish and were used as a natural tag to identify individuals that may
   have moved into the CAWS from LMI. The objectives of this study were to
   (i) estimate relative frequency of individuals with otolith C-13
   indicative of prior residency in LMI among small-bodied (<150mm total
   length) VHS-susceptible fishes collected from several locations in the
   CAWS, and (ii) to assess differences in relative frequency of probable
   immigrants from LMI among CAWS locations that differ in distance from
   the lake. Thirty-six percent of small-bodied fishes collected from the
   CAWS were identified as potential immigrants based on otolith C-13. The
   percentage of individuals that had otolith C-13 suggestive of prior
   residency in LMI was higher among fish collected from the Calumet River
   compared to the Chicago River and North Shore Channel and decreased with
   increasing distance from lock and dam structures at the three entrances
   to the CAWS from the lake. Movement of small-bodied fishes from LMI into
   the CAWS appears to be common and may represent a pathway for
   VHS-susceptible species to transport the virus into the CAWS and

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 22}},
Abstract = {{While modern developments in agriculture have allowed for increases in
   crop yields and rapid human population growth, they have also
   drastically altered biogeochemical cycles, including the
   biotransformation of nitrogen. Denitrification is a critical process
   performed by bacteria and fungi that removes nitrate in surface waters,
   thereby serving as a potential natural remediation strategy. We
   previously reported that constant inundation resulted in a coupling of
   denitrification gene abundances with denitrification rates in sediments,
   but these relationships were not maintained in periodically-inundated or
   noninundated environments. In this study, we utilized Illumina
   next-generation sequencing to further evaluate how the microbial
   community responds to these hydrologic regimes and how this community is
   related to denitrification rates at three sites along a creek in an
   agricultural watershed over 2 years. The hydrologic connectivity of the
   sampling location had a significantly greater influence on the
   denitrification rate (P = 0.010), denitrification gene abundances (P <
   0.001), and the prokaryotic community (P < 0.001), than did other
   spatiotemporal factors (e.g., creek sample site or sample month) within
   the same year. However, annual variability among denitrification rates
   was also observed (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the denitrification rate was
   significantly positively correlated with water nitrate concentration
   (Spearman's rho = 0.56, P < 0.0001), denitrification gene abundances
   (rho = 0.23-0.47, P <= 0.006), and the abundances of members of the
   families Burkholderiaceae, Anaerolinaceae, Microbacteriaceae,
   Acidimicrobineae incertae sedis, Cytophagaceae, and Hyphomicrobiaceae
   (rho = 0.17-0.25, P <= 0.041). Prokaryotic community composition
   accounted for the least amount of variation in denitrification rates
   (22\%), while the collective influence of spatiotemporal factors and
   gene abundances accounted for 37\%, with 40\% of the variation related
   to interactions among all parameters. Results of this study suggest that
   the hydrologic connectivity at each location had a greater effect on the
   prokaryotic community than did spatiotemporal differences, where
   inundation is associated with shifts favoring increased denitrification
   potential. We further establish that while complex interactions among
   the prokaryotic community influence denitrification, the link between
   hydrologic connectivity, microbial community composition, and genetic
   potential for biogeochemical cycling is a promising avenue to explore
   hydrologic remediation strategies such as periodic flooding.}},

Abstract = {{The Arctic hydrologic cycle is intensifying, as evidenced by increased
   rates of precipitation, evapotranspiration, and riverine discharge.
   However, the controls on water fluxes from terrestrial to aquatic
   systems in upland Arctic landscapes are poorly understood. Upland
   landscapes account for one third of the Arctic land surface and are
   often drained by zero-order geomorphic flowpath features called water
   tracks. Previous work in the region attributed rapid runoff response at
   larger stream orders to water tracks, but models suggest water tracks
   are hydrologically disconnected from the surrounding hillslope. To
   better understand the role of water tracks in upland landscapes, we
   investigated the surface and subsurface hydrologic responses of 6 water
   tracks and their hillslope watersheds to natural patterns of rainfall,
   soil thaw, and drainage. Between storms, both water track discharge and
   the water table in the hillslope watersheds exhibited diel fluctuations
   that, when lagged by 5hr, were temporally correlated with peak
   evapotranspiration rate. Water track soils remained saturated for more
   of the summer season than soils in their surrounding hillslope
   watersheds. When rainfall occurred, the subsurface response was nearly
   instantaneous, but the water tracks took significantly longer than the
   hillslopes to respond to rainfall, and longer than the responses
   previously observed in nearby larger order Arctic streams. There was
   also evidence for antecedent soil water storage conditions controlling
   the magnitude of runoff response. Based on these observations, we used a
   broken stick model to test the hypothesis that runoff production in
   response to individual storms was primarily controlled by rainfall
   amount and antecedent water storage conditions near the water track
   outlet. We found that the relative importance of the two factors varied
   by site, and that water tracks with similar watershed geometries and at
   similar landscape positions had similar rainfall-runoff model
   relationships. Thus, the response of terrestrial water fluxes in the
   upland Arctic to climate change depends on the non-linear interactions
   between rainfall patterns and subsurface water storage capacity on
   hillslopes. Predicting these interactions across the landscape remains
   an important challenge.}},

Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Droughts and other extreme precipitation events are predicted to
   increase in intensity, duration, and extent, with uncertain implications
   for terrestrial carbon (C) sequestration. Soil wetting from above
   (precipitation) results in a characteristically different pattern of
   pore-filling than wetting from below (groundwater), with larger,
   well-connected pores filling before finer pore spaces, unlike
   groundwater rise in which capillary forces saturate the finest pores
   first. Here we demonstrate that pore-scale wetting patterns interact
   with antecedent soil moisture conditions to alter pore-scale,
   core-scale, and field-scale C dynamics. Drought legacy and wetting
   direction are perhaps more important determinants of short-term C
   mineralization than current soil moisture content in these soils. Our
   results highlight that microbial access to C is not solely limited by
   physical protection, but also by drought or wetting-induced shifts in
   hydrologic connectivity. We argue that models should treat soil moisture

Abstract = {{Stream restoration practices frequently aim to increase connectivity
   between the stream channel and its floodplain to improve channel
   stability and enhance water quality through sediment trapping and
   nutrient retention. To measure the effectiveness of restoration and to
   understand the drivers of these functional responses, we monitored five
   restored urban streams that represent a range of channel morphology and
   restoration ages. High and low elevation floodplain plots were
   established in triplicate in each stream to capture variation in
   floodplain connectivity. We measured ecosystem geomorphic and soil
   attributes, sediment and nutrient loading, and rates of soil nutrient
   biogeochemistry processes (denitrification; N and P mineralization) then
   used boosted regression trees (BRT) to identify controls on
   sedimentation and nutrient processing. Local channel and floodplain
   morphology and position within the river network controlled connectivity
   with increased sedimentation at sites downstream of impaired reaches and
   at floodplain plots near the stream channel and at low elevations. We
   observed that nitrogen loading (both dissolved and particulate) was
   positively correlated with denitrification and N mineralization and
   dissolved phosphate loading positively influenced P mineralization;
   however, none of these input rates or transformations differed between
   floodplain elevation categories. Instead, continuous gradients of
   connectivity were observed rather than categorical shifts between inset
   and high floodplains. Organic matter and nutrient content in floodplain
   soils increased with the time since restoration, which highlights the
   importance of recovery time after construction that is needed for
   restored systems to increase ecosystem functions. Our results highlight
   the importance of restoring floodplains downstream of sources of
   impairment and building them at lower elevations so they flood
   frequently, not just during bankfull events. This integrated approach
   has the greatest potential for increasing trapping of sediment,
   nutrients, and associated pollutants in restored streams and thereby
   improving water quality in urban watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{Governments worldwide do not adequately protect their limited freshwater
   systems and therefore place freshwater functions and attendant ecosystem
   services at risk. The best available scientific evidence compels
   enhanced protections for freshwater systems, especially for impermanent
   streams and wetlands outside of floodplains that are particularly
   vulnerable to alteration or destruction. New approaches to freshwater
   sustainability - implemented through scientifically informed adaptive
   management - are required to protect freshwater systems through periods
   of changing societal needs. One such approach introduced in the US in
   2015 is the Clean Water Rule, which clarified the jurisdictional scope
   for federally protected waters. However, within hours of its
   implementation litigants convinced the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth
   Circuit to stay the rule, and the subsequently elected administration
   has now placed it under review for potential revision or rescission.
   Regardless of its outcome at the federal level, policy and management
   discussions initiated by the propagation of this rare rulemaking event
   have potential far-reaching implications at all levels of government
   across the US and worldwide. At this timely juncture, we provide a
   scientific rationale and three policy options for all levels of
   government to meaningfully enhance protection of these vulnerable
   waters. A fourth option, a `do-nothing' approach, is wholly inconsistent
   with the well-established scientific evidence of the importance of these
   vulnerable waters.}},

Abstract = {{Shallow aquifers typically have greater hydrologic connectivity and
   response to recharge and changes in surface water management practices
   than deeper aquifers and are therefore often managed to reduce the risk
   of flooding. Quantification of the water table elevation response under
   different management scenarios provides valuable information in shallow
   aquifer systems to assess indirect influences of such modifications. The
   episodic master recession method was applied to the 15-min water table
   elevation and NEXRAD rainfall data for 6 wells to identify water table
   response and individual rainfall events. The objectives of this study
   were to evaluate the effects of rainfall, water table elevation, canal
   stage, site-specific characteristics, and canal structure
   modification/water management practice on the fluctuations in water
   table elevations using multiple/stepwise multiple linear regression
   techniques. With the modification of canal structure and operation
   adjustment, significant difference existed in water table response in
   the southern wells due to its relative downstream position regarding the
   general groundwater flow direction and the structural modification
   locations. On average, water table response height and flood risk were
   lower after than before the structure modification to canals. The effect
   of rainfall event size on the height of water table response was greater
   than the effect of antecedent water table elevation and canal stage on
   the height of water table response. Other factors including leakance of
   the canal bed sediment, specific yield, and rainfall on i-1day had
   significant effects on the height of water table response as well.
   Antecedent water table elevation and canal stage had greater and more
   linear effects on the height of water table response after the
   management changes to canals. Variation in water table response
   height/rainfall event size ratio was attributed to difference in S-y,
   antecedent soil water content, hydraulic gradient, rainfall size, and
   run-off ratio. After the structure modification, water table response
   height/rainfall event size ratio demonstrated more linear and
   proportional relationship with antecedent water table elevation and
   canal stage.}},

   we adopt spatial resistance averaging, based on channel and patch

   largely controls discharge sensitivity, with smaller effects from
   channel connectivity and vegetation patch fractal dimension. However,
   connectivity and patch configuration become increasingly important near

   Connectivity also interacts with other drivers; flow through poorly

Abstract = {{Complete transformations of land cover from prairie, wetlands, and
   hardwood forests to row crop agriculture and urban centers are thought
   to have caused profound changes in hydrology in the Upper Midwestern US
   since the 1800s. In this study, we investigate four large (23 000-69 000
   km(2)) Midwest river basins that span climate and land use gradients to
   understand how climate and agricultural drainage have influenced basin
   hydrology over the last 79 years. We use daily, monthly, and annual flow
   metrics to document streamflow changes and discuss those changes in the
   context of precipitation and land use changes. Since 1935, flow,
   precipitation, artificial drainage extent, and corn and soybean acreage
   have increased across the region. In extensively drained basins, we
   observe 2 to 4 fold increases in low flows and 1.5 to 3 fold increases
   in high and extreme flows. Using a water budget, we determined that the
   storage term has decreased in intensively drained and cultivated basins
   by 30-200 \% since 1975, but increased by roughly 30 \% in the less
   agricultural basin. Storage has generally decreased during spring and
   summer months and increased during fall and winter months in all
   watersheds. Thus, the loss of storage and enhanced hydrologic
   connectivity and efficiency imparted by artificial agricultural drainage
   appear to have amplified the streamflow response to precipitation
   increases in the Midwest. Future increases in precipitation are likely
   to further intensify drainage practices and increase streamflows.
   Increased streamflow has implications for flood risk, channel
   adjustment, and sediment and nutrient transport and presents unique
   challenges for agriculture and water resource management in the Midwest.
   Better documentation of existing and future drain tile and ditch
   installation is needed to further understand the role of climate versus
   drainage across multiple spatial and temporal scales.}},

Abstract = {{Landslides typically alter hillslope topography, but may also change the
   hydrologic connectivity and subsurface water-storage dynamics. In
   settings where mobile materials are not completely evacuated from steep
   slopes, influences of landslide disturbances on hillslope hydrology and
   susceptibility to subsequent failures remain poorly characterized. Since
   landslides often recur at the site of previous failures, we examine
   differences between a stable vegetated hillslope (VH) and a recent
   landslide (LS). These neighboring hillslopes exhibit similar topography
   and are situated on steep landslide-prone coastal bluffs of glacial
   deposits along the northeastern shore of Puget Sound, Washington. Our
   control hillslope, VH, is mantled by a heterogeneous colluvium,
   supporting a dense forest. In early 2013, our test hillslope, LS, also
   supported a forest before a landslide substantially altered the
   topography and disturbed the hillslope. In 2015, we observed a clay-rich
   landslide deposit at LS with sparse vegetation and limited root
   reinforcement, soil structures, and macropores. Our characterization of
   the sites also found matrix porosity and hydraulic conductivity are both
   lower at LS. Continuous monitoring during 2015-2016 revealed reduced
   effective precipitation at VH (due to canopy interception), an earlier
   seasonal transition to near-saturated conditions at LS, and longer
   persistence of positive pore pressures and slower drainage at LS (both
   seasonally and between major storm events). These differences, along
   with episodic, complex slope failures at LS support the hypothesis that,
   despite a reduced average slope, other disturbances introduced by
   landsliding may promote the hydrologic conditions leading to slope
   instability, thus contributing to the persistence of landslide hazards.
   Plain Language Summary The most deadly landslides in recent U.S. history
   resulted from reactivation of existing landslides. Motivated by these
   tragedies and other landslide-related losses, we investigated why recent
   landslides may be less stable than similar hillslopes nearby. We
   collected observations and monitoring data from two neighboring
   hillslopes sharing similar geology and steep topography, near Seattle,
   Washington; one hillslope where a landslide occurred recently and a
   second that was stable and forested. We found that this second hillslope
   remained stable in part because roots reinforce the soils, but also
   because the vegetated soils drain efficiently following major
   rainstorms. In contrast, the existing landslide on the other hillslope
   disrupted vegetation and altered the soil properties, reducing drainage
   efficiency. As a result, the landslide materials became wetter earlier
   in the winter rainy season than the soils of the neighboring vegetated
   hillslope and also stayed wetter longer after the rains ended. The
   combination of reduced root reinforcement and the persistence of wetter
   soil promoted repeated slope failures at the landslide hillslope. These
   new insights into the ``self-driving{''} factors contributing to
   landslide recurrence can be used to inform residents in landslide-prone
   areas and improve landslide hazard assessments to help reduce
   landslide-related losses.}},

Journal = {{ECOHYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Forested wetlands dominated by black ash (Fraxinus nigra) are currently
   threatened by the rapid expansion of the exotic emerald ash borer (EAB;
   Agrilus planipennis, Coleoptera: Buprestidae) in North America, and very
   little is known about the hydrology and ecology of black ash wetlands.
   The ecohydrological response of forested wetlands following a canopy
   disturbance has the potential to affect critical ecosystem services, and
   the degree of this effect may largely depend on the wetland's
   hydrogeological setting. The main objectives of this study were to
   characterize the hydrologic connectivity of uninfested black ash
   wetlands and evaluate the water table response to a simulated EAB
   disturbance. We hypothesized that black ash wetlands in northern
   Michigan were (a) seasonally connected to, and derived the majority of
   their water from groundwater, and (b) wetland water tables would be
   elevated following a simulated EAB infestation due to decreased
   transpiration with the loss of black ash. The results indicate that the
   black ash wetland sites received most of their water from groundwater
   discharge. Significantly smaller site transpiration fluxes and
   significantly slower rates of drawdown were detected during the growing
   season in the girdled and ash-cut treatment sites, and these responses
   collectively produced significantly elevated wetland water tables when
   compared to control sites in the latter portions of the growing season.
   However, the wetlands' strong connection with groundwater sources likely
   buffered the magnitude of hydrological responses associated with the
   loss of black ash from the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Because of the significant role soils play in the health and function of
   the Everglades ecosystem, soil conservation is a central tenet of
   Everglades restoration. As such, it is critical to anticipate ecosystem
   responses to hydrologic restoration activities from the perspective of
   the soil component. The broad goal of this work was to investigate the
   resulting effects of various hydrologic restoration scenarios on soil
   processes of phosphorus and carbon accretion by modeling soil edaphic
   processes using the Everglades Landscape Model. The results of modeling
   effort suggest that full implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades
   Restoration Plan provides the greatest spatial reduction of phosphorus

   (ECB) scenario, which represents the current hydrologic and nutrient
   impaired condition, produced the highest observed rates of soil carbon
   accretion; however, this scenario is successful in accretion of soil
   carbon due to elevated P conditions, not restored hydrology. Management
   implications of restoration with respect to soil elucidated from this

Abstract = {{1. Increases in habitat connectivity can have consequences for
   taxonomic, functional, and genetic diversity of communities. Previously
   isolated aquatic habitats were connected with canals and pipelines in
   the largest water development project in the US history, the Columbia
   Basin Project (CBP; eastern Washington, USA), which also altered
   environmental conditions; however, the ecological consequences are
   largely unknown.
   2. Using a historical dataset, we examined long-term patterns in
   zooplankton communities, water chemistry and clarity, testing the
   hypothesis that increased connectivity will result in taxonomic
   homogenization. Further, we tested contemporary drivers of communities
   using a comprehensive set of environmental and landscape variables.
   3. Waterbodies were sampled for zooplankton community composition as
   well as physical and chemical variables inside and outside the CBP using
   methods consistent with historical studies.
   4. We found significant declines in salinity inside the CBP, whereas
   changes in water clarity were prevalent across all waterbodies.
   Increased connectivity via canals homogenized zooplankton communities
   over time, as well as increasing regional richness. Other long-term
   changes in zooplankton communities may be related to climate change,
   invasive species, and land-use changes.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Though canals may offer species spatial
   refugia, homogenization may decrease resilience to environmental

Abstract = {{Urbanization threatens headwater stream ecosystems globally. Watershed
   restoration practices, such as infiltration-based stormwater management,
   are implemented to mitigate the detrimental effects of urbanization on
   aquatic ecosystems. However, their effectiveness for restoring
   hydrologic processes and watershed storage remains poorly understood.
   Our study used a comparative hydrology approach to quantify the effects
   of urban watershed restoration on watershed hydrologic function in
   headwater streams within the Coastal Plain of Maryland, USA. We selected
   11 headwater streams that spanned an urbanization-restoration gradient
   (4 forested, 4 urban-degraded, and 3 urban-degraded) to evaluate changes
   in watershed hydrologic function from both urbanization and watershed
   restoration. Discrete discharge and continuous, high-frequency
   rainfall-stage monitoring were conducted in each watershed. These
   datasets were used to develop 6 hydrologic metrics describing changes in
   watershed storage, flowpath connectivity, or the resultant stream flow
   regime. The hydrological effects of urbanization were clearly observed
   in all metrics, but only 1 of the 3 restored watersheds exhibited
   partially restored hydrologic function. At this site, a larger minimum
   runoff threshold was observed relative to the urban-degraded watersheds,
   suggesting enhanced infiltration of stormwater runoff within the
   restoration structure. However, baseflow in the stream draining this
   watershed remained low compared to the forested reference streams,
   suggesting that enhanced infiltration of stormwater runoff did not
   recharge subsurface storage zones contributing to stream baseflow. The
   highly variable responses among the 3 restored watersheds were likely
   due to the spatial heterogeneity of urban development, including the
   level of impervious cover and extent of the storm sewer network. This
   study yielded important knowledge on how restoration strategies, such as
   infiltration-based stormwater management, modulatedor failed to
   modulatehydrological processes affected by urbanization, which will help
   improve the design of future urban watershed management strategies. More

Abstract = {{Although floodplain restoration may improve stream-riparian connectivity
   and increase channel stability through cross-vane installation, stream
   bank regrading, and buffer revegetation, the impact of these geomorphic
   alterations on denitrification across the aquatic-terrestrial interface
   is poorly understood. Seasonal denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) was
   compared in stream-riparian ecotones of four streams with varying
   hydrologic connection, riparian vegetation composition, and agricultural
   influence. Riparian and stream DEA was generally higher in sites
   adjacent to agricultural fields due to proximity to nitrate source. Mean
   DEA was higher in the dormant season (riparian: 928 +/- 116 ng N g(-1)
   dry mass {[}DM] h(-1), stream: 108 +/- 149 ng N g(-1) DM h(-1)) than in
   the growing season (riparian: 355 +/- 55 ng N g(-1) DM h(-1), stream: 45
   +/- 40 ng N g(-1) DM h(-1)) and was influenced by antecedent
   precipitation, soil texture, and landscape characteristics (land use,
   vegetation type, topography) in multivariate models. Hot spots of
   denitrification occurred at the confluence of fine soil textures with
   high organic matter and moisture, often at low-lying areas of the
   landscape. At the restored site, we observed enhanced denitrification in
   the reconnected floodplain but decreased stream denitrification capacity
   in pools. Across all sites, streams had lower DEA than riparian zones,
   stressing the importance of restoration approaches designed to conserve
   riparian areas and maintain hydrologic connectivity. Easily obtainable
   data including precipitation, adjacent land use, vegetation, and stream
   and floodplain geomorphology reasonably predicted denitrification
   potential compared with more complex models, showing potential for
   application in water resources and nitrogen management.}},

   deposited in a representative small lake after land conversion was

   Sediment consisted of low-density clay deposited above dense silt loam.
   Organic carbon (C) and Cs-137 profiles had lower and upper concentration
   maxima. The lower maxima established the circa 1970 lakebed at <= 0.9 m
   (3 ft) above the morphological discontinuity and from 2.1 to 1.3 m (6.9
   to 4.3 ft) below the 2000 lakebed at positions midlake and halfway to
   the bank, respectively. The upper maxima were likely due to progressive
   land conversion around the lake, coupled with increasing clay content of
   sediment upwards to the 2000 lakebed. A quiescent settling model was
   used to estimate the composition of runoff water necessary to produce
   the depth, texture, and density of sediment above the lower Cs-137

Abstract = {{Hydrological connectivity processes along the lower Amazon River
   floodplain at Lago Miratuba Floodplain (LMF) were analyzed based on
   remote sensing and field measurements. Connectivity processes are
   related to 12 geomorphic sub-units of the floodplain that are
   interconnected at different stage thresholds through channelized and
   overbank flow paths, while lakes act as reservoirs for flood waters,
   local rainfall, and water table saturation-seepage. Hydrological
   connectivity processes along the floodplain happen through complex
   internal routings of water flows over space and time, mainly along
   floodplain channels and breached levees. The contribution of local
   recharge (mainly rainfall) was decoupled from river recharge (river
   hydrological connection to floodplain) because precipitations and local
   runoff also recharge the floodplain. The hydrological connectivity of
   the 12 geomorphic units varied significantly from each other, because
   the inundation and the floodplain connections with the river were
   initiated at specific river stage thresholds for each sub-unit.
   An interesting finding is that connections with the river for all units
   were initiated through channelized flows below the bankfull stage of the
   Amazon River. The connectivity processes over different geomorphic units
   are also not correlated with their minimum distance (shortest lines)
   from the river. This implies that a ``flood pulse{''} model largely
   concerned with lateral connectivity (mostly through overbank diffusion)
   only partially explains the complex hydrological connectivity processes
   at a regional scale along the complex lower Amazon River floodplain.
   Thus, for hydrological connectivity assessments in the Amazon River
   floodplain, reach-by-reach scale studies have to be carried out,
   relating the hydro-geomorphologic processes (channelized flow routing
   paths, overbank diffusion, and local recharge) to the internal
   geomorphic variability and complexity of the floodplain. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Urban stream features can be used to promote nutrient retention;
   however, their interactions with different hydrological regimes impact
   nutrient cycling, decrease their retention capacity, and inhibit stream
   ecosystem functioning. This study analysed the temporal and spatial
   dynamics of the uptake of three nutrients (nitrate, ammonium, and
   phosphorus) in an urban drainage stream during high flows. In
   particular, we studied variations in net uptake along the right margin
   (with native vegetation and a roots mat) comparatively to the left
   margin (a non-rooted grassy bank). Applying the spiralling approach
   within each subreach on either side, we determined nutrient subreach
   (sr) retention metrics: uptake rate coefficients K-net(sr), mass
   transfer rates (vf(net)(sr)), and areal uptake rates (U-net(sr)). Our
   results showed nitrate (NO3) and ammonium (NH4) net uptakes on the right
   side were higher and more frequent along subreaches where the root mat
   was more abundant (U-net(sr) {[}mu g m(-2) s(-1)] = 22.80 +/- 1.13 for
   NO3 and 10.50 +/- 0.81 for NH4), whereas on the left side both nutrients
   showed patchy and inconsistent net uptake patterns despite the
   homogeneous grass distribution. Net uptake for filtered reactive
   phosphorus (FRP) was not observed on either side at any flow rate. The
   impact of hydrological factors such as discharge, travel time, water
   depth, and concentration, on uptake metrics was studied. Despite
   increases in travel time as the flow decreased, there was a reduction in
   net uptake rates, vf(net)(sr) and U-net(sr), on either side. This was
   attributed to a reduction in water level with declining flows, which
   decreased hydrologic connectivity with the stream banks, combined with a
   decrease in water velocity and a reduction in nutrient concentrations.
   We concluded the rooted bank acted as an effective retention area by
   systematically promoting net uptake resulting in a twofold increased
   dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) retention relative to the non-rooted
   side where net uptake was spatially localized and highly dynamic.
   Overall, this work emphasized the importance of strategically sampling
   close to biologically active surfaces to more accurately determine areas
   where gross uptake surpasses release process.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Inland water bodies and their surface hydrologic connections are active
   components in the landscape, influencing multiple ecological processes
   that can propagate to broad-scale phenomena such as regional nutrient
   and carbon cycles and metapopulation dynamics. However, while lake,
   wetland, and stream abundance has been estimated at regional and global
   extents, less attention has been paid to freshwater connectivity
   attributes among aquatic systems at macroscales. Thus, regional to
   continental patterns of freshwater abundance and connectivity are poorly
   understood. We measured lake, wetland, and stream abundance and surface
   connectivity attributes (i.e., landscape position within stream
   networks) at a subcontinental extent in the Midwest and Northeast United
   States to characterize macroscale spatial patterns of the freshwater
   landscape (i.e., abundance and connectivity attributes of lakes,
   wetlands, and streams). We found that lake and wetland abundance
   exhibited opposite spatial patterns from stream density that generally
   followed glaciation extent boundaries-lake and wetland abundance was
   high north of the glaciation boundary, whereas stream density was high
   south of the glaciation boundary. Freshwater connectivity attributes
   exhibited distinct spatial patterns as defined by our integrated
   freshwater clusters and revealed a layer of complexity not captured by
   abundance measures. Patterns of freshwater abundance and connectivity in
   the study extent were associated primarily with glaciation and
   secondarily with hydrogeomorphic (e.g., surficial geology and
   topography), climate (e.g., runoff), and land-use (e.g., agriculture)
   variables, providing insight into potential drivers of freshwater
   composition and distribution. The connectivity spatial patterns observed
   suggest that relying solely on freshwater abundance measures in
   macroscale analyses omits unique information on the structural
   attributes of freshwater systems that can be critical to key ecological
   processes. Adopting an integrated freshwater landscape framework to
   study and manage freshwaters is essential as freshwater systems face
   broad-scale disturbances that may alter hydrologic connections and
   subsequently may impact ecosystem processes and services.}},

Abstract = {{Many aquatic plant species are distributed over large areas and diverse
   environments with populations interconnected by abiotic and biotic
   mediators. Here, we examined differences and similarities in the
   population genetic structure of six sympatric and widespread aquatic
   plant species. We sampled the aquatic species from six Chinese lakes
   found on plateaus, plains, and different river systems and analyzed them
   using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Samples originating
   from each lake tended to cluster together. Of the six species, only
   Nymphoides peltata and Myriophyllum spicatum could be divided into
   plateau and plain groups, once Taihu Lake individuals were excluded.
   Genetic similarities between populations connected by the Yangtze River
   were not consistently higher than unconnected populations. Populations
   from Taihu Lake and/or Weishanhu Lake were distant from other lake
   populations for all species except Potamogeton lucens. The Taihu and
   Weishanhu populations clustered for Ceratophyllum demersum and Typha
   latifolia. Hydrophilous C.demersum had the lowest gene flow (Nm=0.913),
   whereas the entomophilous Hydrocharisdubia (Nm=2.084) and N.peltata
   (Nm=2.204) had the highest gene flow. The genetic relationships among
   distant populations of aquatic plants reflect the comprehensive effects
   of environmental selection pressure and biotic and abiotic connectivity.
   Differences in environmental factors between plateau and plain lakes and
   long distance hydrochory have limited importance on aquatic plant
   genetic structures. Among multiple evolutionary forces, gene flow
   mediated by birds may play the most important role in the formation of
   genetic patterns in the six species examined. For example, the close
   genetic relationship between Taihu Lake and Weishanhu Lake populations,
   each in different river systems and with different climates, may be
   related to the migration routes of birds. Differences in gene flow among
   the six aquatic plants may be attributable to different bird-transport
   and the fruit traits of each species.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a new representation of coupled solute and water age
   dynamics at the catchment scale, which shows how the contributions of
   young runoff waters can be directly referenced to observed water quality
   patterns. The methodology stems from recent trends in hydrologic
   transport that acknowledge the dynamic nature of streamflow age and
   explores the use of water age fractions as an alternative to the mean
   age. The approach uses a travel time-based transport model to compute
   the fractions of streamflow that are younger than some thresholds (e.g.,
   younger than a few weeks) and compares them to observed solute
   concentration patterns. The method is here validated with data from the
   Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest during spring 2008, where we show that
   the presence of water younger than roughly 2 weeks, tracked using a
   hydrologic transport model and deuterium measurements, mimics the
   variation in dissolved silicon concentrations. Our approach suggests
   that an age-discharge relationship can be coupled to classic
   concentration-discharge relationship, to identify the links between
   transport timescales and solute concentration. Our results highlight
   that the younger streamflow components can be crucial for determining
   water quality variations and for characterizing the dominant hydrologic

Abstract = {{In hydrological terms, raised bogs are often approximated by simple
   models as in the acrotelm-catotelm concept. However, raised bogs are
   often characterized by a pronounced surface topography, causing large
   changes in connectivity of contributing areas on the bog. In this study,
   daily regression of measured discharges versus catchment areas is used
   to quantify the impact of surface topography on catchment connectivity
   within a raised bog. The resulting coefficient of determination shows
   the strength of the relationship between the discharge and catchment
   area over time under different hydrological conditions. Monitoring of
   discharge, water table, transmissivity, and basic weather data on a
   raised bog (1.9km(2)) in eastern central Estonia took place from May
   2008 to June 2010. Contributing areas, calculated based on the outlet's
   discharge volume (V-Q) divided by the net precipitation volume ( VPnet),
   of the outlet containing the central pool-ridge system varied between
   1x10(-3) and 0.7km(2), suggesting significant differences in
   connectivity between hydrological events. Correlation between discharge
   and theoretical catchment size was high (R-2>0.75) when the water table
   was close to the surface (less than 5cm below peat surface), and
   consequently, transmissivities were also high (up to 1,030m(2)d(-1)),
   which led to connectivity of local storage elements, such as pools and
   hollows. However, a water table below this threshold resulted in large
   parts of the catchment being disconnected. The importance of water table
   depths on catchment connectivity suggests the need to reconsider the
   hydrological concept of raised bogs; to incorporate these shallow flow
   components and better understand residence time and consequently
   transport of solutes, such as DOC, from patterned peatlands.}},

Abstract = {{In traditional watershed delineation and topographic modeling, surface
   depressions are generally treated as spurious features and simply
   removed from a digital elevation model (DEM) to enforce flow continuity

   landscape features with seasonal to permanent inundation patterning
   characterized by nested hierarchical structures and dynamic

   Differentiating and appropriately processing such ecohydrologically
   meaningful features remains a major technical terrain-processing

Abstract = {{The relative importance of catchment's water provenance and flow paths
   varies in space and time, complicating the conceptualization of the
   rainfall-runoff responses. We assessed the temporal dynamics in source
   areas, flow paths, and age by End Member Mixing Analysis (EMMA),
   hydrograph separation, and Inverse Transit Time Proxies (ITTPs)
   estimation within a headwater catchment in the Ecuadorian Andes.
   Twenty-two solutes, stable isotopes, pH, and electrical conductivity
   from a stream and 12 potential sources were analyzed. Four end-members
   were required to satisfactorily represent the hydrological system, i.e.,
   rainfall, spring water, and water from the bottom layers of Histosols
   and Andosols. Water from Histosols in and near the riparian zone was the
   highest source contributor to runoff throughout the year (39\% for the
   drier season, 45\% for the wetter season), highlighting the importance
   of the water that is stored in the riparian zone. Spring water
   contributions to streamflow tripled during the drier season, as
   evidenced by geochemical signatures that are consistent with deeper flow
   paths rather than shallow interflow through Andosols. Rainfall exhibited
   low seasonal variation in this contribution. Hydrograph separation
   revealed that 94\% and 84\% is preevent water in the drier and wetter
   seasons, respectively. From low-flow to high-flow conditions, all the
   sources increased their contribution except spring water. The relative
   age of stream water decreased during wetter periods, when the
   contributing area of the riparian zone expands. The multimethod and
   multitracer approach enabled to closely study the interchanging
   importance of flow processes and water source dynamics from an

Abstract = {{Wildfires can impact streamflow by modifying net precipitation,
   infiltration, evapotranspiration, snowmelt, and hillslope run-off
   pathways. Regional differences in fire trends and postwildfire
   streamflow responses across the conterminous United States have spurred
   concerns about the impact on streamflow in forests that serve as water
   resource areas. This is notably the case for the Western United States,
   where fire activity and burn severity have increased in conjunction with
   climate change and increased forest density due to human fire
   suppression. In this review, we discuss the effects of wildfire on
   hydrological processes with a special focus on regional differences in
   postwildfire streamflow responses in forests. Postwildfire peak flows
   and annual water yields are generally higher in regions with a
   Mediterranean or semi-arid climate (Southern California and the
   Southwest) compared to the highlands (Rocky Mountains and the Pacific
   Northwest), where fire-induced changes in hydraulic connectivity along
   the hillslope results in the delivery of more water, more rapidly to
   streams. No clear streamflow response patterns have been identified in
   the humid subtropical Southeastern United States, where most fires are
   prescribed fires with a low burn severity, and more research is needed
   in that region. Improved assessment of postwildfire streamflow relies on
   quantitative spatial knowledge of landscape variables such as prestorm
   soil moisture, burn severity and correlations with soil surface sealing,
   water repellency, and ash deposition. The latest studies furthermore
   emphasize that understanding the effects of hydrological processes on
   postwildfire dynamic hydraulic connectivity, notably at the hillslope
   and watershed scales, and the relationship between overlapping
   disturbances including those other than wildfire is necessary for the
   development of risk assessment tools.}},

Abstract = {{Water resources and transportation infrastructure such as dams and

   barrier addition (e.g. dam and road construction), reengineering (e.g.

   to: (i) restore and reconnect potentially large habitat patches quickly
   and effectively and (ii) avoid impacts prior to occurrence in line with
   the mitigation hierarchy (i.e. avoid then minimize then mitigate). This
   paper synthesizes 46 watershed-scale barrier planning studies and
   presents a procedure to guide barrier prioritization associated with
   connectivity for aquatic organisms. We focus on practical issues
   informing prioritization studies such as available data sets, methods,

Abstract = {{Many concepts have been proposed to explain hydrologic connectivity of
   hillslopes with streams. Hydrologic connectivity is most often defined
   by qualitative assessment of spatial patterns in perched water tables or
   soil moisture on hillslopes without a direct linkage to water flow from
   hillslopes to streams. This form of hydrologic connectivity may not
   explain the hydrologic response of catchments that have network(s) of
   preferential flow paths, for example, soil pipes, which can provide
   intrinsic connectivity between hillslopes and streams. Duplex soils are
   known for developing perched water tables on hillslopes and fostering
   lateral flows, but the connectivity of localized perched water tables on
   hillslopes with soil pipes has not been fully established. The
   objectives of this study were to characterize pipeflow dynamics during
   storm events, the relationships between perched water tables on
   hillslopes and pipeflows, and their threshold behaviour. Two
   well-characterized catchments in loess soil with a fragipan were
   selected for study because they contain multiple, laterally extensive
   (over 100 m) soil pipe networks. Hillslopes were instrumented with
   shallow wells adjacent to the soil pipes, and the wells and pipe
   collapse features were equipped with pressure transducers. Perched water
   tables developed on hillslopes during a wetting up period
   (October-December) and became well connected spatially across hillslope
   positions throughout the high flow period (January-March). The water
   table was not spatially connected on hillslopes during the drying out
   (April-June) and low flow (July-September) periods. Even when perched
   water tables were not well-connected, water flowing through soil pipes
   provided hydrologic connectivity between upper hillslopes and catchment
   outlets. Correlations between soil pipeflow and perched water tables
   depended on the size and location of soil pipes. The threshold
   relationship between available soil-moisture index plus storm
   precipitation and pipeflow was dependent on the season and strongest
   during dry periods and not high-flow seasons. This study demonstrated
   that soil pipes serve as a catchment backbone of preferential flow paths
   that provide intrinsic connectivity between upper hillslopes and
   streams.}},

Abstract = {{River networks that drain mountain landscapes alternate between narrow
   and wide valley segments. Within the wide segments, beaver activity can
   facilitate the development and maintenance of complex, multithread
   planform. Because the narrow segments have limited ability to retain
   water, carbon, and nutrients, the wide, multithread segments are likely
   important locations of retention. We evaluated hydrologic dynamics,
   nutrient flux, and aquatic ecosystem metabolism along two adjacent
   segments of a river network in the Rocky Mountains, Colorado: (1) a
   wide, multithread segment with beaver activity; and, (2) an adjacent
   (directly upstream) narrow, single-thread segment without beaver
   activity. We used a mass balance approach to determine the water,
   carbon, and nutrient source-sink behavior of each river segment across a
   range of flows. While the single-thread segment was consistently a
   source of water, carbon, and nitrogen, the beaver impacted multithread
   segment exhibited variable source-sink dynamics as a function of flow.
   Specifically, the multithread segment was a sink for water, carbon, and
   nutrients during high flows, and subsequently became a source as flows
   decreased. Shifts in river-floodplain hydrologic connectivity across
   flows related to higher and more variable aquatic ecosystem metabolism
   rates along the multithread relative to the single-thread segment. Our
   data suggest that beaver activity in wide valleys can create a
   physically complex hydrologic environment that can enhance hydrologic
   and biogeochemical buffering, and promote high rates of aquatic
   ecosystem metabolism. Given the widespread removal of beaver,
   determining the cumulative effects of these changes is a critical next
   step in restoring function in altered river networks.}},

Abstract = {{Suspended particles are an essential component of large rivers
   influencing channel geomorphology, biogeochemical cycling of nutrients,
   and food web resources. The Upper Mississippi River is a large
   floodplain river that exhibits pronounced spatiotemporal variation in
   environmental conditions and biota, providing an ideal environment for
   investigating dynamics of suspended particles in large river ecosystems.
   Here we investigated two questions: (i) How do suspended particle
   characteristics (e.g. size and morphology) vary temporally and
   spatially? and (ii) What environmental variables have the strongest
   association with particle characteristics? Water sampling was conducted
   in June, August, and September of 2013 and 2014 in Navigation Pool 19 of
   the Upper Mississippi River. A FlowCAM((R)) (Flow Cytometer and
   Microscope) particle imaging system was used to enumerate and measure
   particles 53-300 mu m in diameter for size and shape characteristics
   (e.g. volume, elongation, and symmetry). Suspended particle
   characteristics varied considerably over space and time and were
   strongly associated with discharge and concentrations of nitrate +
   nitrite (NO3-) and soluble reactive phosphorus. Particle characteristics
   in backwaters were distinct from those in other habitats for most of the
   study period, likely due to reduced hydrologic connectivity and higher
   biotic production in backwaters. During low discharge, phytoplankton and
   zooplankton made up relatively greater proportions of the observed
   particles. Concurrently during low discharge, concentrations of
   chlorophyll, volatile suspended solids, and total phosphorus were
   higher. Our results suggest that there are complex interactions among
   space, time, discharge, and other environmental variables (e.g. water
   nutrients), which drive suspended particle dynamics in large rivers.

Abstract = {{Understanding how rivers respond to changes in land cover, climate, and
   subsurface conditions is critical for sustainably managing water
   resources and ecosystems. In this study, long-term hydrologic, climate,
   and satellite data (1973-2012) from the Upper Tahe River watershed
   (2359km(2)) in the Da Hinggan Mountains of northeast China were analysed
   to quantify the relative hydrologic effects of climate variability
   (system input) and the combined influences of forest cover change and
   permafrost thaw (system characteristics) on average annual streamflow
   (system response) using 2 methods: the sensitivity-based method and the
   Kendall-Theil robust line method. The study period was subdivided into a
   forest harvesting period (1973-1987), a forest stability period
   (1988-2001), and a forest recovery period (2002-2012). The results
   indicated that the combined effects of forest harvesting and permafrost
   thaw on streamflow (+ 47.0mm) from the forest harvesting period to the
   forest stability period was approximately twice as large as the effect
   associated with climate variability (+20.2mm). Similarly, from the
   forest stability period to the forest recovery period, the decrease in
   average annual streamflow attributed to the combined effects of forest
   recovery and permafrost thaw (-38.0mm) was much greater than the
   decrease due to climate variability (-22.2mm). A simple method was used
   to separate the distinct impacts of forest cover change and permafrost
   thaw, but distinguishing these influences is difficult due to changes in
   surface and subsurface hydrologic connectivity associated with
   permafrost thaw. The results highlight the need to consider multiple
   streamflow drivers in future watershed and aquatic ecosystem management.
   Due to the ecological and hydrological susceptibility to disturbances in
   the Da Hinggan Mountains, forest harvesting will likely negatively
   impact ecohydrological processes in this region, and the effects of
   forest species transition in the forest recovery process should be
   further investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal variation may influence the ability of best management
   practices (BMPs) to Mitigate the loss of agricultural pollutants to
   streams. Our goal was to assess variation in mitigation effects of BMPs
   by examining the associations between instream nutrient concentrations
   and the abundance and location of four structural BMPs over a hydrologic
   year. Water samples were collected monthly (Nov. 2013-Oct. 2014) in 15
   headwater streams representing a gradient of BMP use in Southern
   Ontario, Canada. Partial least squares (PLS) regression models were used
   to associate two groups of collinear nutrient forms with the abundance
   and location of BMPs, antecedent precipitation and time of year. BMP
   metrics in PLS models were associated with instream concentrations of
   major phosphorus forms and ammonium throughout the year. In contrast,
   total nitrogen and nitrate-nitrite were only associated with BMPs during
   snowmelt. BMP metrics associated with reductions of phosphorus and
   ammonium included greater abundances of riparian buffers and manure
   storage structures, but not livestock restriction fences. Likewise, the
   abundance and location riparian vegetation in areas capturing more
   surface runoff were associated With decreased stream nitrogen
   concentrations during snowmelt. However, the amount of tile drainage was
   associated with increased nitrogen concentrations following snowmelt, as
   well as with greater phosphorUs and ammonium concentrations throughout
   the year. Overall, our findings indicate that increasing the abundance
   of riparian buffers and manure storage structures may decrease instream
   nutrient concentrations in agricultural areas. Additionally, the
   implementation of these structural BMPs appear to be an effective
   yearround strategy to assist management objectives in reducing
   phosphorus concentrations in small agricultural streams and thus
   loadings to downstream tributaries. Further mitigation measures, such as
   managerial BMPs and controlled tile drainage, may be required to further
   reduce instream nutrient concentrations during baseflow periods and
   snowmelt events. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   available and diverse data sets.These data sets act as multiple lines of
   evidence in supporting comparisons between data sets to test the
   validity of developed methods and the application of such methods. In
   order to synthesise these data as well as to determine the fluctuations
   in riparian ecosystem service provision a scoring system was developed.
   Methodologically, the scoring system proved informative across the
   majority of ecosystem services categories, showing close to 80\%
   similarity in outcomes when comparing the scoring method to trends in
   long-term water quality measurements. Other benefits of the scoring
   system included its design simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and
   applicability and replicability across various urban settings.
   Empirically, the data sets used support the findings of the ecosystem
   services scoring exercise and suggests that fluctuations in ecosystem
   service delivery through time and across the river reaches are linked to
   land-use change and other human activities. Findings suggest that as
   water leaves an urban protected area and travels across transformed and
   impacted landscapes, the results are poor water quality and diminished
   ability of rivers to yield ecosystem services the further the river
   flows into the urban setting. Urbanisation and changes in land-uses in

Abstract = {{Information about catchment-scale groundwater dynamics is necessary to
   understand how catchments store and release water and why water quantity
   and quality varies in streams. However, groundwater level monitoring is
   often restricted to a limited number of sites. Knowledge of the factors
   that determine similarity between monitoring sites can be used to
   predict catchment-scale groundwater storage and connectivity of
   different runoff source areas. We used distance-based and
   correlation-based similarity measures to quantify the spatial and
   temporal differences in shallow groundwater similarity for 51 monitoring
   sites in a Swiss prealpine catchment. The 41 months long time series
   were preprocessed using Dynamic Time-Warping and a Flow-corrected Time
   Transformation to account for small timing differences and bias toward
   low-flow periods. The mean distance-based groundwater similarity was
   correlated to topographic indices, such as upslope contributing area,
   topographic wetness index, and local slope. Correlation-based similarity
   was less related to landscape position but instead revealed differences
   between seasons. Analysis of variance and partial Mantel tests showed
   that landscape position, represented by the topographic wetness index,
   explained 52\% of the variability in mean distance-based groundwater
   similarity, while spatial distance, represented by the Euclidean
   distance, explained only 5\%. The variability in distance-based
   similarity and correlation-based similarity between groundwater and
   streamflow time series was significantly larger for midslope locations
   than for other landscape positions. This suggests that groundwater
   dynamics at these midslope sites, which are important to understand
   runoff source areas and hydrological connectivity at the catchment
   scale, are most difficult to predict.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrologic connectivity between streams and their valley bottoms
   (stream corridor) is a critical determinant of their ecological
   function. Ecological functions are known to be spatially and temporally
   variable, but spatial dimensions of the problem are not easily
   quantified and thus they are usually overlooked. To estimate the spatial
   patterns of connectivity, and how connectivity varies with changes in
   discharge, we developed the hyporheic potential model. We used the model
   to interpret a series of solute tracer injections in two headwater
   mountain streams with contrasting valley bottom morphologies to estimate
   connectivity in the stream corridor. The distributions of flow path
   origination locations and the lengths of hyporheic flow paths appear to
   vary with base flow recession, even in cases where transport timescales
   are apparently unchanged. The modeled distribution of origination
   locations further allowed us to define a spatial analog to the temporal
   window of detection associated with solute tracer studies, and enables
   assessment of connectivity dynamics between streams and their corridors.
   Altogether, the reduced complexity hyporheic potential model provides an
   easy way to anticipate the spatial distribution and origination
   locations of hyporheic flow paths from a basic understanding of the
   valley bottom characteristics and solute transport timescales.
   Plain Language Summary The manuscript details a simple method to assess
   the spatial connectivity of streams and their riparian zones. While the
   timescales of exchange in the river corridor have been broadly studied,
   the complimentary spatial dimension (i.e., the geometry of exchange
   flowpaths) remains largely unknown. The major challenge in assessing the
   spatial dimensions of exchange is the limited information available in
   the subsurface. Here, we develop a reduced complexity model of valley
   bottom transport to overcome these information limitations. With this
   model, relatively simple field site characterization and solute tracer
   data are combined to assess the spatial distribution of downwelling
   along a headwater mountain stream. We validate the model with a
   numerical experiment, and demonstrate its application in two watersheds
   of contrasting geology, repeated through baseflow recession.}},

Abstract = {{Concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships are often used to quantify
   source water contributions and biogeochemical processes occurring within
   catchments, especially during discrete hydrological events. Yet, the
   interpretation of C-Q hysteresis is often confounded by complexity of
   the critical zone, such as numerous source waters and hydrochemical
   nonstationarity. Consequently, researchers must often ignore important
   runoff pathways and geochemical sources/sinks, especially the hyporheic
   zone because it lacks a distinct hydrochemical signature. Such
   simplifications limit efforts to identify processes responsible for the
   transience of C-Q hysteresis over time. To address these limitations, we
   leverage the hydrologic simplicity and long-term, high-frequency Q and
   electrical conductivity (EC) data from streams in the McMurdo Dry
   Valleys, Antarctica. In this two end-member system, EC can serve as a
   proxy for the concentration of solutes derived from the hyporheic zone.
   We utilize a novel approach to decompose loops into subhysteretic EC-Q
   dynamics to identify individual mechanisms governing hysteresis across a
   wide range of timescales. We find that hydrologic and hydraulic
   processes govern EC response to diel and seasonal Q variability and that
   the effects of hyporheic mixing processes on C-Q transience differ in
   short and long streams. We also observe that variable hyporheic turnover
   rates govern EC-Q patterns at daily to interannual timescales. Last,
   subhysteretic analysis reveals a period of interannual freshening of
   glacial meltwater streams related to the effects of unsteady flow on
   hyporheic exchange. The subhysteretic analysis framework we introduce
   may be applied more broadly to constrain the processes controlling C-Q
   transience and advance understanding of catchment evolution.}},

Abstract = {{More freshwater ecosystems are drying in response to global change
   thereby posing serious threat to freshwater biota and functions. The
   production of desiccation-resistant forms is an important adaptation
   that helps maintain biodiversity in temporary freshwaters by buffering
   communities from drying, but its potential to mitigate the negative
   effects of drying in freshwater ecosystems could vary greatly across
   regions and ecosystem types. We explored this context dependency by
   quantifying the potential contribution of desiccation-resistance forms
   to invertebrate community recovery across levels of regional drying
   prevalence (defined as the occurrence of drying events in freshwaters in
   a given region) and ecosystem types (lentic, lotic) in temporary
   neotropical freshwaters. We first predicted that regional drying
   prevalence influences the selection of species with
   desiccation-resistant forms from the regional species pools and thus
   increases the ability of communities to recover from drying. Second, we
   predicted lentic freshwaters harbor higher proportions of species with
   desiccation-resistant forms compared to lotic, in response to contrasted
   hydrologic connectivity. To test these predictions, we used natural
   experiments to quantify the contribution of desiccation-resistant forms
   to benthic invertebrate community recovery in nine intermittent streams
   and six geographically isolated temporary wetlands from three Bolivian
   regions differing in drying prevalence. The contribution of
   desiccation-resistant forms to community recovery was highest where
   regional drying prevalence was high, suggesting the species pool was
   adapted to regional disturbance regimes. The contribution of
   desiccation-resistant forms to community recovery was lower in streams
   than in wetlands, emphasizing the importance of hydrologic connectivity
   and associated recolonization processes from in-stream refuges to
   recovery in lotic systems. In all regions, the majority of functional
   traits were present in desiccation-resistant taxa indicating this
   adaptation may help maintain ecosystem functions by buffering
   communities from the loss of functional traits. Accounting for regional
   context and hydrologic connectivity in community recovery processes
   following drying can help refine predictions of freshwater biodiversity

Abstract = {{Emerging theory suggests that biotic communities in floodplain wetlands

   lateral connectivity of floodplain habitats with main river channels.
   However, useful invertebrate indicators of floodplain condition remain
   poorly developed. Snails as a group possess several attributes that
   should make them useful as potential environmental indicators. In this
   study, we sampled snail assemblages in 12 floodplain wetlands along
   Wusuli River (headwater, mid, and downstream reaches) in Northeastern
   China's Sanjiang Plain. In addition, at 10 sites, comparisons between
   river-connected and levee-isolated wetlands were performed. Results
   demonstrated that snail assemblages were concurrently being impacted by
   river reach, and whether the wetlands were isolated from the river, or
   not. Using multivariate analyses, the studied wetlands were divided into
   three major groups based on snail assemblages: downstream, mid, and
   headwater reaches. Seven snail species were significant indicators of
   these wetland groups. Because snail assemblages vary strongly both
   longitudinally along and laterally across floodplain habitats of

Abstract = {{Cold-based polar glacier watersheds contain well-defined supraglacial,
   ice-marginal, and proglacial elements that differ in their degree of
   hydrologic connectivity, sources of water (e.g., snow, ice, and/or
   sediment pore water), meltwater residence times, allochthonous and
   autochthonous nutrient, and sediment loads. We investigated 11 distinct
   hydrological units along the supraglacial, ice marginal, and proglacial
   flow paths that drain Joyce Glacier in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of
   Antarctica. We found that these units play unique and important roles as
   sources and/or sinks for dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dissolved
   inorganic phosphorus and for specific fractions of dissolved organic
   matter (DOM) as waters are routed from the glacier into nutrient-poor
   downstream ecosystems. Changes in nutrient export from the glacial
   system as a whole were observed as the routing and residence times of
   meltwater changed throughout the melt season. The concentrations of
   major ions in the proglacial stream were inversely proportional to
   discharge, such that there was a relatively constant trickle of these
   solutes into downstream ecosystems. In contrast, NO3- concentrations
   generally increased with discharge, resulting in delivery of episodic
   pulses of dissolved inorganic nitrogen-rich water (treats) into those
   same ecosystems during high discharge events. DOM concentrations or
   fluorescence did not correlate with discharge rate, but high variability
   in DOM concentrations or fluorescence suggests that DOM may be exported
   downstream as episodic treats, but with spatial and/or temporal patterns
   that remain poorly understood. The strong, nutrient-specific responses
   to changes in hydrology suggest that polar glacier drainage systems may
   export meltwater with nutrient compositions that vary within and between
   melt seasons and watersheds. Because nutrient dynamics identified in
   this study differ between glacier watersheds with broadly similar
   hydrology, climate, and geology, we emphasize the need to develop
   conceptual models of nutrient export that thoroughly integrate the
   biogeochemical and hydrological processes that control the sources,
   fate, and export of nutrients from each system.}},

Abstract = {{Abiotic factors structure plant community composition and ecosystem
   function across many different spatial scales. Often, such variation is
   considered at regional or global scales, but here we ask whether
   ecosystem-scale simulations can be used to better understand
   landscape-level variation that might be particularly important in
   complex terrain, such as high-elevation mountains. We performed
   ecosystem-scale simulations by using the Community Land Model (CLM)
   version 4.5 to better understand how the increased length of growing
   seasons may impact carbon, water, and energy fluxes in an alpine tundra
   landscape. The model was forced with meteorological data and validated
   with observations from the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research
   Program site. Our results demonstrate that CLM is capable of reproducing
   the observed carbon, water, and energy fluxes for discrete vegetation
   patches across this heterogeneous ecosystem. We subsequently accelerated
   snowmelt and increased spring and summer air temperatures in order to
   simulate potential effects of climate change in this region. We found
   that vegetation communities that were characterized by different snow
   accumulation dynamics showed divergent biogeochemical responses to a
   longer growing season. Contrary to expectations, wet meadow ecosystems
   showed the strongest decreases in plant productivity under extended
   summer scenarios because of disruptions in hydrologic connectivity.
   These findings illustrate how Earth system models such as CLM can be
   used to generate testable hypotheses about the shifting nature of
   energy, water, and nutrient limitations across space and through time in
   heterogeneous landscapes; these hypotheses may ultimately guide further
   experimental work and model development.
   Plain Language Summary Projecting ecosystem response to environmental
   change presents enormous challenges that are critical to understand for
   multiple stakeholders. These projections are complicated by complex
   interactions between physical drivers, like temperature and
   precipitation, and biotic agents like plants, animals, and soil
   microbes. Using long-term observations from a heterogeneous alpine
   ecosystem and a state-of-the-art land model, we explore how the physical
   environment shapes ecosystem function and how the function of this
   ecosystem may respond to climate change. We found that the land model
   was able to capture observed water, energy, and carbon fluxes from this
   well-studied alpine ecosystem, lending credibility to our results. Our
   simulations also indicated that earlier snowmelt and warmer summertime
   temperatures might drive divergent plant responses across the landscape.
   Notably, climate change may decouple the timing of snowmelt that
   delivers critical water resources from periods when plants experience
   the greatest water demand, thus altering plant productivity.
   Additionally, this work raises ecological questions that can be
   addressed with additional experimentation and/or model development.}},

Abstract = {{We examined nitrogen transport and wetland primary production along

Abstract = {{The development of shrub willow as a bioenergy feedstock contributes to

   various ages (2 and 5 years) and management strategies (fertilized vs.
   unfertilized) compared to corn and hay on water table depth, soil water
   NO3- and PO43- concentrations, and (NO)-O-2, CH4, and CO2 fluxes at the

   water concentrations resulted in higher PO43- in willow and higher NO3-
   in corn and hay, although willow is unlikely to negatively impact water
   quality with respect to phosphorus due to shorter periods of hydrologic
   connectivity in willow and hay than in corn. Gas fluxes varied spatially
   and temporally with hot moments of CH4 and N2O in corn and hay and
   seasonally variable CO2 in willow. While CH4 did not vary between
   fields, N2O was higher in corn and hay, and CO2 in willow, resulting in
   no net difference between CO2 equivalent (CH4, CO2, and N2O) emissions
   between fields. Converting marginal cropland on clay soils from corn or
   hay to willow left overall GHG emissions unaffected, slightly increased

Abstract = {{This study provides an in-depth analysis of the runoff generation
   dynamics and hydrological connectivity across upland-wetland transitions
   within a wetland-dominated headwater basin in the Western Boreal Plain

   largely by differences in the timing and magnitude of precipitation
   relative to potential evapotranspiration, hence antecedent moisture
   conditions, which varied markedly over the four-year study (April-Sept).
   Runoff coefficients for individual precipitation events ranged from <1
   to >90\% depending on storm dynamics and antecedent conditions. Owing to
   its higher elevation, the basin received 55\% more precipitation per
   month on average compared to 30-year climate normals and an average of
   86 mm more precipitation per season than the nearby regional weather
   station. The wetland and adjacent forestlands became coupled during
   intermittent wet periods which generated substantial runoff. The

Abstract = {{Riverine floodplains are ecologically and economically valuable
   ecosystems that are heavily threatened by anthropogenic stressors.
   Microbial communities in floodplain soils mediate critical
   biogeochemical processes, yet we understand little about the
   relationship between these communities and variation in hydrologic
   connectivity related to land management or topography. Here, we present
   metagenomic evidence that differences among microbial communities in
   three floodplain soils correspond to a long-term gradient of hydrologic
   connectivity. Specifically, all strictly anaerobic taxa and metabolic
   pathways were positively associated with increased hydrologic
   connectivity and flooding frequency. In contrast, most aerobic taxa and
   all strictly aerobic pathways were negatively related to hydrologic
   connectivity and flooding frequency. Furthermore, the genetic potential
   to metabolize organic compounds tended to decrease as hydrologic
   connectivity increased, which may reflect either the observed
   concomitant decline of soil organic matter or the parallel increase in
   both anaerobic taxa and pathways. A decline in soil N, accompanied by an
   increased genetic potential for oligotrophic N acquisition subsystems,
   suggests that soil nutrients also shape microbial communities in these
   soils. We conclude that differences among floodplain soil microbial
   communities can be conceptualized along a gradient of hydrologic
   connectivity. Additionally, we show that these differences are likely
   due to connectivity-related variation in flooding frequency, soil
   organic matter, and soil N. Our findings are particularly relevant to
   the restoration and management of microbially mediated biogeochemical
   processes in riverine floodplain wetlands.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial isolation of soil organic carbon (SOC) in different sized pores
   may be a mechaniSm by which otherwise labile carbon (C) could be
   protected in soils. When soil water content increases, the hydrologic
   connectivity of soil pores also increases, allowing greater transport Of
   SOC and other resources from protected locations, to microbially
   colonized locations more favorable to decomposition. The heterogeneous
   distribution of specialized decomposers, C, and other resources
   throughout the soil ihdicates that the metabolism or persistence of soil
   C compounds is highly dependent on short-distance transport processes.
   The objective of this research was to characterize the complexity of C
   in pore waters held at weak and strong water tensions (effectively soil
   solution held behind coarse- and fine-pore throats, respectively) and
   evaluate the microbial decomposability of these pore waters. We
   saturated intact soil cores and extracted pore waters with increasing
   suction pressures to sequentially sample pore waters from increasingly
   fine pore domains. Ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry of the SOC was
   used to profile the major biochemical classes (i.e., lipids, proteins,
   lignin, carbohydrates, and condensed aromatics) of compounds present in
   the pore waters; some of these samples were then used as substrates for
   growth of Cellvibrio japonicus (DSMZ 16018), Streptomyces cellulosae
   (ATCC (R) 25439 (TM)), and Trichoderma reseei (QM6a) in 7 day
   incubations. The soluble C in finer pores was more complex than the
   soluble C in coarser pores, and the incubations revealed that the more
   complex C in these fine pores is not recalcitrant. The decomposition of
   this complex C led to greater losses of C through respiration than the
   simpler C from coarser pore waters. Our research suggests that soils
   that experience repeated cycles of drying and wetting may be accompanied
   by repeated cycles of increased CO2 fluxes that are driven by i) the
   transport of C from protected pools into active, ii) the chemical
   quality of the potentially soluble C, and iii) the type of
   microorganisms most likely to metabolize this C. (C) 2016 Battelle

   connectivity in terms of timing and length of connections. Slow
   subsurface connections between wetlands and the downstream river
   originate from wetlands throughout the watershed, whereas fast surface
   connections were limited to large events and originate from wetlands
   located near the river. This modeling approach provides first ever

Abstract = {{Resource pulsing is a widespread phenomenon, but its effects on
   ecosystem dynamics are often difficult to predict. Hydrological pulsing,
   in particular, is known to influence the structure and dynamics of
   fluvial and coastal ecosystems, but little information is available
   about its effects on trophic connectivity between wetlands and
   estuaries. We investigated the hypothesis that hydrologic pulsing drives
   1-way trophic subsidies (e.g. suspended organic matter and freshwater
   fish) from wetland to estuary. Our study system is a coastal lagoon with
   an ephemeral mouth that, when closed, stores freshwater as a sustained
   flood pulse that is subsequently released when a connection with the sea
   is reestablished. We monitored isotopic composition of consumers and
   food sources over the course of an entire flood pulse to infer trophic
   linkages and spatial subsidies. Before the flood peak (April and May),
   freshwater and estuarine zones were largely dependent on local primary
   production sources (seston and C-3 plants vs. C-4 plants and
   microphytobenthos, respectively), essentially functioning as
   disconnected compartments. A sustained pulse of freshwater inflow (June
   to August) induced greater habitat connectivity and a net flow of
   biomass and energy from the freshwater zone into the estuarine zone. The
   opening of the lagoon outlet channel abruptly terminated the flood pulse
   and reduced freshwater subsidies to estuarine consumers, and both zones
   returned to dependence on autochthonous production. Our findings
   contribute to current concerns that artificial opening of sandbars in
   coastal lagoons alters natural ecological dynamics with significant
   effects on biodiversity and ecosystem processes.}},

Abstract = {{A physically-based, distributed-parameter hydrologic model was used to
   simulate a recent flood event in the city of Hafr Al Batin, Saudi Arabia
   to gain a better understanding of the runoff generation and spatial
   distribution of flooding. The city is located in a very arid catchment.
   Flooding of the city is influenced by the presence of three major
   tributaries that join the main channel in and around the heavily
   urbanized area. The Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global
   Precipitation Measurement Mission (IMERG) rainfall product was used due
   to lack of detailed ground observations. To overcome the heavy
   computational demand, the catchment was divided into three
   sub-catchments with a variable model grid resolution. The model was run
   on three sub-catchments separately, without losing hydrologic
   connectivity among the sub-catchments. Uncalibrated and calibrated
   satellite products were used producing different estimates of the
   predicted runoff. The runoff simulations demonstrated that 85\% of the
   flooding was generated in the urbanized portion of the catchments for
   the simulated flood. Additional model simulations were performed to
   understand the roles of the unique channel network in the city flooding.
   The simulations provided insights into the best options for flood
   mitigation efforts. The variable model grid size approach allowed using
   physically-based, distributed models-such as the Gridded Surface
   Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis (GSSHA) model used in this study-on large

Abstract = {{Indicators of landscape condition should be selected based on their
   sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to provide early
   warning detection of those changes. We assessed the performance of a
   suite of spatial-pattern metrics selected to quantify the condition of
   the ridge-slough landscape in the Everglades (South Florida, USA).
   Spatial pattern metrics (n = 14) that describe landscape composition,
   geometry and hydrologic connectivity were enumerated from vegetation
   maps of twenty-five 2 x 2 km primary sampling units (PSUs) that span a
   gradient of hydrologic and ecological condition across the greater
   Everglades ecosystem. Metrics were assessed in comparison with field
   measurements from each PSU of landscape condition obtained from regional
   surveys of soil elevation, which have previously been shown to capture
   dramatic differences between conserved and degraded locations.
   Elevation-based measures of landscape condition included soil elevation
   bi-modality (BisE), a binary measure of landscape condition, and also
   the standard deviation of soil elevation (SDsE), a continuous measure of
   condition. Metric performance was assessed based on the strength
   (sensitivity) and shape (leading vs. lagging) of the relationship
   between spatial pattern metrics and these elevation-based measures. We
   observed significant logistic regression slopes with BISE for only 4
   metrics (slough width, ridge density, directional connectivity index
   DCI, and least flow cost LFC). More significant relationships (n = 8
   metrics) were observed with SDsE, with the strongest associations for
   slough density, mean ridge width, and the average length of straight
   flow, as well as for a suite of hydrologic connectivity metrics (DCI,
   LFC and landscape discharge competence LDC). Leading vs. lagging
   performance, inferred from the curvature of the association obtained
   from the exponent of fitted power functions, suggest that only DCI was a
   leading metric of the loss of soil elevation variation; most metrics
   were indeterminate, though some were clearly lagging. Our findings
   support the contention that soil elevation changes from altered peat
   accretion dynamics precede changes in landscape pattern, and offer
   insights that will enable efficient monitoring of the ridge-slough
   landscape as part of the ongoing Everglades restoration effort. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The spatial variability of watershed characteristics has to be

   has great influence on the generation of runoff and other hydrologic
   processes. Physically based, distributed-parameter models can use
   detailed watershed data that are becoming more readily available to
   improve hydrologic simulations. However, the computational penalty can
   be very high for simulations over large catchments. In this study, a
   physically based, distributed-parameter hydrologic model was used to
   simulate different flooding events over an 11,285 basin at 150 m 150 m
   grid resolution. To overcome the computational demand, the model was run
   on nine sub-catchments separately, without losing hydrologic
   connectivity among the sub-catchments. The outflow from an upstream
   sub-basin was used as the inflow into the next sub-basin, allowing this
   inflow to join the flow generated in the downstream sub-basin in a
   dynamic mode. Rainfall data from weather radar were used as input. This
   approach also allowed excluding certain sub-basins from the model
   simulations without affecting the hydrologic connectivity. A calibration
   was performed on one sub-basin only, and then, the model was validated
   over the entire watershed. The simulation results were reasonable and
   similar to results from single catchment simulations. By using this
   approach, it was possible to employ observed stream discharge at
   interior points of a catchment as part of the model inputs. It will also
   make it possible to run fully distributed, physically based models over

Abstract = {{Hydrologic connectivity has been proposed as an important concept for
   understanding local processes in the context of catchment hydrology. It
   can be useful for characterizing the soil moisture variability in
   complex heterogeneous landscapes. The current land surface models (e.g.,
   Community Land Model, CLM) could not completely account for flow path
   continuity and connected patterns of subsurface properties in the
   unsaturated zone. In this study, we developed a physically based
   hydrologic connectivity algorithm based on dominant physical controls
   (e.g., topography, soil texture, and vegetation) to better understand
   the spatially distributed subsurface flow and improve the
   parameterization of soil hydraulic properties in hydrological modeling.
   We investigated the effects of mixed physical controls on soil moisture
   spatial variability and developed hydrologic connectivity using various
   thresholds. The connectivity was used for identifying the soil moisture
   variability and applied in a distributed land surface model (CLM) for
   calibrating soil hydraulic properties and improving model performance
   for estimating spatially distributed soil moisture. The proposed concept
   was tested in two watersheds (Little Washita in Oklahoma and Upper South
   Skunk in Iowa) comparing estimated soil moisture with the airborne
   remote sensing data (Electronically Scanning Thinned Array Radiometer
   and Polarimetric Scanning Radiometer). Our finding demonstrated that the
   spatial variations of soil moisture could be described well using
   physically based hydrologic connectivity, and the land surface model
   performance was improved by using the calibrated (distributed) soil
   hydraulic parameters. In addition, we found that the calibrated soil
   hydraulic parameters significantly affect model outputs not only on the

Abstract = {{In this study, an improved two-dimensional (2D) model is proposed for
   simulating shallow water flows over complex bathymetry through their
   subgrid modeling. The proposed model delineates the detailed unevenness

   other common 2D hydrodynamic models by specifying the bed elevation at
   more than one point in an element. The relationship between submerged
   area and water stage and the relationship between water volume and water
   stage can then be preprocessed for every specified element. The process
   is similar to how cross sections are handled in standard one-dimensional
   models. Thus, the 2D model can simulate the open channel flow accurately
   and efficiently, with only one element been applied over the channel
   width. The proposed model was tested using a hypothetical channel flow
   with an analytical solution and a real river-coast system with measured
   data. The simulations showed that the model could achieve the same level
   of accuracy using a coarse mesh as that obtained by previous 2D models

Abstract = {{Intertidal soft-sediment ecosystems such as mangrove, saltmarsh, and

   function, and capacity for ecosystem services of these habitats are
   significantly affected by anthropogenic loss of hydrologic connectivity,
   introduction of invasive exotic species, and chemical pollution. These
   dramatic changes to ecosystem structure and function are illustrated by
   four case studies along the East Asian coast: the Mai Po Marshes in Hong
   Kong, the Yunxiao wetlands in Fujian, China, and the Lake Sihwa and
   Saemangeum tidal flats in Korea. While investment in restoration is
   increasing significantly in the region, the lack of key basic knowledge
   on aspects of the behaviour of intertidal soft-sediment ecosystems,
   particularly those in Asia, impairs the effectiveness of these efforts.
   The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function for
   relatively species-poor mangrove, seagrass, and saltmarsh systems has
   implications for restoration targeting monospecific plantations. The
   trajectory of recovery and return of ecosystem function and services is
   also poorly known, and may deviate from simple expectations. As many
   introduced species have become established along the East Asian coast,
   their long-term impact on ecosystem function as well as the

   theme of Connectivity in Geomorphology. Six key sub themes emerged:
   sediment connectivity, hydrologic connectivity, geochemical
   connectivity, riverine connectivity, landscape connectivity, and
   modeling of connectivity. Papers presented at the symposium and
   collected in this special issue elucidate the theoretical and conceptual
   underpinnings of connectivity but also provide field-based and
   analytical approaches to document the fundamental role of connectivity
   in geomorphic and ecological functioning. Among the consistent themes
   that emerged from the papers and from discussion during the symposium
   were (1) the interconnectedness of diverse forms of connectivity, (2)
   the appropriateness (or not) of conceptualizing connectivity as a
   gradient or continuum, and (3) the importance of an explicitrecognition
   of disconnectivity as a mechanism to retain ecologically important
   materials and organisms within landscapes. Knowledge gaps identified in
   discussions during the symposium include: identifying questions that can
   be usefully addressed within a framework emphasizing connectivity;
   identifying feedbacks that enhance and limit connectivity; and
   quantification of diverse aspects of connectivity, of thresholds of
   connectivity, and of interactions among different types of connectivity.

Abstract = {{Many deltas, including the Mississippi River Delta, have been losing
   land at fast rates compromising the safety and sustainability of their
   ecosystems. Knowledge of delta vulnerability has raised global concern
   and stimulated active interdisciplinary research as deltas are densely
   populated landscapes, rich in agriculture, fisheries, oil and gas, and
   important means for navigation.
   There are many ways of looking at this problem which all contribute to a
   deeper understanding of the functioning of coastal systems. One aspect
   that has been overlooked thus far, yet fundamental for advancing delta
   science is connectivity, both physical (how different portions of the
   system interact with each other) as well as conceptual (pathways of
   process coupling).
   In,this paper, I propose a framework called Delta Connectome for
   studying connectivity in river deltas based on different representations
   of a delta as a network. After analyzing the classic network
   representation as a set of nodes (e.g., bifurcations and junctions or
   regions with distinct physical or statistical behavior) and links (e.g.,
   channels), I show that from connectivity considerations the delta
   emerges as a leaky network that continuously exchanges fluxes of matter,
   energy, and information with its surroundings and evolves over time. I
   explore each network representation and show through several examples
   how quantifying connectivity can bring to light aspects of deltaic
   systems so far unexplored and yet fundamental to understanding system
   functioning and informing coastal management and restoration. This paper
   serves both as an introduction to the Delta Connectome framework as well
   as a review of recent applications of the concepts of network and
   connectivity to deltaic systems within the Connectome framework. (C)

Abstract = {{Hydrologic connectivity has received great attention recently as our
   conceptual models of watersheds and water quality have evolved in the
   past several decades. However, the structural complexity of most
   temperate watersheds (i.e. connections among shallow soils, deep
   aquifers, the atmosphere and streams) and the dynamic seasonal changes
   that occur within them (i.e., plant senescence which impacts
   evapotranspiration) create significant challenges to characterizing or
   quantifying hydrologic connectivity. The McMurdo Dry Valleys, a polar
   desert in Antarctica, provide a unique opportunity to study hydrologic
   connectivity because there is no vegetative cover (and therefore no
   transpiration), and no deep aquifers connected to surface soils or
   streams. Glacier melt provides stream flow to well-established channels
   and closed-basin, ice-covered lakes on the valley floor. Streams are
   also connected to shallow hyporheic zones along their lengths, which are
   bounded at similar to 75 cm depth by ice-cemented permafrost. These
   hydrologic features and connections provide water for and underpin
   biological communities. Hence, exchange of water among them provides a
   vector for exchange of energy and dissolved solutes. Connectivity is
   dynamic on timescales of a day to a flow season (6-12 weeks), as
   streamflow varies over these timescales. The timescales over which these
   connections occur is also dynamic. Exchanges between streams and
   hyporheic zones, for example, have been estimated to be as short as
   hours to as long as several weeks. These exchanges have significant
   implications for the biogeochemistry of these systems and the biotic
   communities in each feature. Here we evaluate the lessons we can learn
   about hydrologic connectivity in the MDV watersheds that are simplified
   in the context of processes occurring and water reservoirs included in
   the landscape, yet are sensitive to climate controls and contain
   substantial physical heterogeneity. We specifically explore several
   metrics that are simple and/or commonly employed in hydrologic analyses
   and interpret them in the context of connectivity between and among
   hydrologic features. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Geomorphic controls on ecohydrological connections, while implicit in
   processes such as the derivation of transpired water from alluvial
   aquifers, have not been systematically investigated. In this artide we
   test the hypothesis that geomorphic setting is an important control on
   groundwater-sourced riparian evapotranspiration (ET) through a
   statistical investigation of 30 years of daily flow data, monthly
   precipitation data, and semimonthly satellite images at fourteen
   1-km-long river reaches representing a range of geomorphic settings in
   the semiarid landscape of New Mexico, USA. We focus on correlations
   between vegetation greenness (as a surrogate for vigor and transpiration
   rates), interannual variability in flow and rainfall characteristics,
   and valley metrics such as width, slope, and concavity. Sites were
   considered individually and in groups based on classification as
   perennial or intermittent. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used
   to distill related metrics into significant, uncorrelated,
   interpretable, underlying variables. Components were interpreted in the
   same manner as a factor analysis and were found to include overall
   magnitude of greenness, within-summer variability of greenness, overall
   wetness, rain vs. flow dominance, snowmelt vs. monsoon dominance, and
   mountain vs. basin geomorphic setting, among others. To broadly test the
   hypothesis that geomorphology affects the relationship between wetness
   and greenness, best subset regressions were constructed for the full
   range of sites and groups using all wetness and geomorphic components as
   potential predictor variables and greenness metrics as response
   variables. From our analysis we draw two main conclusions: (1) including
   geomorphic parameters provides new information that is nonredundant with
   precipitation and flow parameters in predicting vegetation extent and
   vigor. The parameters, especially curvature, may indicate causal
   processes, such as increased soil moisture availability on concave
   surfaces with convergent flow paths, or they may provide correlative
   information on the groundwater setting (gaining vs. losing). (2) When
   considering groups of sites, the dominance of precipitation over stream
   flow in delivering moisture was a predictor of high greenness; but this
   was not the case for any individual sites. This indicates that while
   greener communities developed in sites with greater average
   precipitation, at any single site the vegetation was able to adapt to
   either local precipitation or streamflow delivery of moisture in a given
   year and only the magnitude of the moisture delivered affected
   vegetation vigor. These findings emphasize the versatility of riparian
   vegetation to utilize soil moisture in convergent geomorphic settings or
   wet time periods, moisture that may otherwise tend to evaporate. (C)

Abstract = {{Waterfalls create barriers to fish migration, yet hundreds of isolated
   salmonid populations exist above barriers and have persisted for
   thousands of years in steep mountainous terrain. Ecological theory
   indicates that small isolated populations in disturbance-prone
   landscapes are at greatest risk of extirpation because immigration and
   re colonization are not possible. On the contrary, many above-barrier
   populations are currently thriving while their downstream counterparts
   are dwindling. This quandary led us to explore geomorphic knickpoints as
   a mechanism for disconnecting hillslope and channel processes by
   limiting channel incision and decreasing the pace of base-level
   lowering. Using LiDAR from the Oregon Coast Range, we found gentler
   channel gradients, wider valleys, lower gradient hillslopes, and less
   shallow landslide potential in an above-barrier catchment compared to a
   neighboring catchment devoid of persistent knickpoints. Based on this
   unique geomorphic template, above-barrier channel networks are less
   prone to debris flows and other episodic sediment fluxes. These
   above-barrier catchments also have greater resiliency to flooding, owing
   to wider valleys with greater floodplain connectivity. Habitat
   preference models further indicate that salmonid habitat is present in
   greater quantity and quality in these above-barrier networks. Therefore
   the paradox of the persistence of small isolated fish populations may be
   facilitated by a geomorphic mechanism that both limits their
   connectivity to larger fish populations yet dampens the effect of
   disturbance by decreasing connections between hillslope and channel
   processes above geomorphic knickpoints. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Hydrological connectivity describes the physical coupling (linkages) of
   different elements within a landscape regarding (sub-) surface flows. A
   firm understanding of hydrological connectivity is important for
   catchment management applications, for example, habitat and species

   Thinking about (geomorphological) systems as networks can lead to new
   insights, which has also been recognized within the scientific
   community, seeing the recent increase in the use of network (graph)
   theory within the geosciences. Network theory supports the analysis and
   understanding of complex systems by providing data structures for
   modelling objects and their linkages, and a versatile toolbox to
   quantitatively appraise network structure and properties. The objective
   of this study was to characterize and quantify overland flow
   connectivity dynamics on hillslopes in a humid sub-Mediterranean
   environment by using a combination of high-resolution digital-terrain
   models, overland flow sensors and a network approach. Results showed
   that there are significant differences between overland flow
   connectivity on agricultural areas and semi-natural shrubs areas.
   Significant positive correlations between connectivity and precipitation
   characteristics were found. Significant negative correlations between
   connectivity and soil moisture were found, most likely because of soil
   water repellency and/or soil surface crusting. The combination of
   structural networks and dynamic networks for determining potential

Abstract = {{The Indian Sundarban Delta (ISD) situated on the western tide-dominated
   part of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta, was formed by the
   sedimentation of the river Ganges and its tributaries. It is
   crisscrossed by several interlinked channels. Most of these rivers which
   used to nourish the delta have become defunct with the passage of time.
   To ensure sustainable flow and to enhance the flow-dependent ecosystem
   services in this region, the identification of the disconnected river
   reaches and their restoration is required. Keeping these perspectives in
   mind, this study has been conducted to identify the discontinuities in
   the flow paths of some major rivers using multispectral satellite
   imageries in geo-informatics platform. To extract the river network from
   the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images, the water indexes like
   Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Modified Normalized
   Difference Water Index (MNDWI) have been calculated. These indexes use
   the differential spectral reflectance of water sensitive near-infrared
   and shortwave-infrared band with green band to identify the derelict
   paths. The spectral profiles of near-infrared band across these
   discontinuous stretches have been compared and validated with field data
   to map the actual blockages. The study reveals that the rivers
   Ichhamati, Jamuna, Bidyadhari, Noai, Suti, Kumarjol, Ghagramari, Karati,
   and Matla have been disconnected from their parent rivers and their
   courses are frequently interrupted by natural and man-made obstructions.
   River Adi Ganga is discontinuous in its middle stretches. The decayed
   river channels have been converted into ponds, agricultural fields, or
   aquaculture farms and have also been encroached by settlements.
   Restoration of these decayed channels may revitalize the river network
   and enhance the benefits of flow-dependent ecosystem services in the

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Novel ecosystems result from a combination of altered historical abiotic
   regimes and new species assemblages. In freshwater systems, novel
   environmental conditions often result from large-scale changes to
   hydrological connectivity as well as species invasions. Novel
   environmental conditions may affect the survival of aquatic fauna by
   altering dispersal patterns and resource fluctuations, and/or may impose
   physiological constraints on native species evolutionarily adapted to
   particular environments. Further, novel systems can provide insight into
   processes driving community structure because re-sorting or filtering of
   regional biota is a likely consequence of decoupling from historical
   conditions. Although several studies document the presence of novel
   conditions, few examine variation or gradients in novelty. The Florida
   Everglades is a highly invaded and hydrologically altered system
   characterized by a large network of canals that compartmentalize the
   ecosystem and act to both increase and decrease connectivity. Little is
   known about how canals in this region function as habitat for native and
   nonnative fishes, the extent to which these canals may function as novel
   habitats, and how these habitat characteristics may influence
   distribution, abundance, and assembly patterns. In this study, we
   examined native and nonnative fish assemblages along a gradient of
   novelty, defined as the loss of wetland connectivity, influence of the
   natural hydrological regime, and habitat complexity (well connected to
   leveed canals). As novelty increased, native species richness and
   abundance strongly declined and the contribution of nonnatives increased
   to nearly 50\%. Vast differences in community structure across the
   novelty gradient were strongly influenced by spatial factors and
   secondarily by hydrological factors, while habitat and abiotic factors
   were of very low relevance. Natives and nonnatives had opposing
   responses to key hydrological and habitat characteristics. Abundance of
   native fishes declined with decreased connectivity to adjacent marshes
   and canal littoral zone width, while nonnative fishes increased
   significantly in the most novel canals. Our results suggest that the
   inherent loss of natural environmental conditions and subsequent
   replacement by novel ones can lead to extensive changes in fish
   community structure. Success or failure at maintaining native
   assemblages will rely heavily on natural resource manager's ability to
   incorporate natural environmental characteristics with ecosystem

   area, controlling for other factors; while 2) an increase in mean annual

   investigated the spatiotemporal variation in fish assemblages and the

Abstract = {{The resolution of a digital elevation model (DEM) is a crucial factor in
   watershed hydrologic and environmental modelling. DEM resolution can
   cause significant variability in the representation of surface
   topography, which further affects quantification of hydrologic
   connectivity and simulation of hydrologic processes. The objective of
   this study is to examine the effects of DEM resolution on (1) surface
   microtopographic characteristics, (2) hydrologic connectivity, and (3)
   the spatial and temporal variations of hydrologic processes. A
   puddle-to-puddle modelling system was utilized for surface delineation
   and modelling of the puddle-to-puddle overland flow dynamics, surface
   runoff, infiltration, and unsaturated flow for nine DEM resolution
   scenarios of a field plot surface. Comparisons of the nine modelling
   scenarios demonstrated that coarser DEM resolutions tended to eliminate
   topographic features, reduce surface depression storage, and strengthen
   hydrologic connectivity and surface runoff. We found that reduction in
   maximum depression storage and maximum ponding area was as high as
   97.56\% and 76.36\%, respectively, as the DEM grid size increased from 2
   to 80 cm. The paired t-test and fractal analysis demonstrated the
   existence of a threshold DEM resolution (10 cm for the field plot),
   within which the DEM-based hydrologic modelling was effective and
   acceptable. The effects of DEM resolution were further evaluated for a
   larger surface in the Prairie Pothole Region subjected to observed
   rainfall events. It was found that simulations based on coarser
   resolution DEMs (> 10 m) tended to overestimate ponded areas and
   underestimate runoff discharge peaks. The simulated peak discharge from
   the Prairie Pothole Region surface reduced by approximately 50\% as the
   DEM resolution changed from 2 to 90m. Fractal analysis results
   elucidated scale dependency of hydrologic and topographic processes. In
   particular, scale analysis highlighted a unique constant-threshold-power
   relationship between DEM scale and topographic and hydrologic
   parameters/variables. Not only does this finding allow one to identify
   threshold DEM but also further develop functional relationships for
   scaling to achieve valid topographic characterization as well as
   effective and efficient hydrologic modelling. Copyright (C) 2016 John

Abstract = {{Intermittent surface connectivity can influence aquatic systems, since
   chemical and biotic movements are often associated with water flow.
   Although often referred to as fill and spill, wetlands also fill and
   merge. We examined the effects of these connection types on water
   levels, ion concentrations, and biotic communities of eight prairie
   pothole wetlands between 1979 and 2015. Fill and spill caused pulsed
   surface water connections that were limited to periods following spring
   snow melt. In contrast, two wetlands connected through fill and merge
   experienced a nearly continuous, 20-year surface water connection and
   had completely coincident water levels. Fill and spill led to minimal
   convergence in dissolved ions and macroinvertebrate composition, while
   these constituents converged under fill and merge. The primary factor
   determining differences in response was duration of the surface water
   connection between wetland pairs. Our findings suggest that
   investigations into the effects of intermittent surface water
   connections should not consider these connections generically, but need
   to address the specific types of connections. In particular, fill and
   spill promotes external water exports while fill and merge favors
   internal storage. The behaviors of such intermittent connections will
   likely be accentuated under a future with more frequent and severe
   climate extremes.}},

Abstract = {{Interannual variation in lake extent is well documented in the Prairie

   surface-water extent, in particular, the expansion of lakes across parts
   of the Prairie Pothole Region can alter landscape-level hydrologic
   connectivity among substantial numbers of previously surficially
   disconnected wetlands. Temporally static wetland, lake, and stream
   datasets were fused with temporally varying Landsat-derived
   surface-water extent maps (1990-2011) to quantify changes in
   surface-water connectivity. Under deluge conditions, lakes were found to
   create significantly larger complexes of surficially-connected wetlands
   relative to non-lake surface-water connections (e.g., only wetlands or
   wetlands and streams). Analysis of three specific lakes showed that
   lakes can merge with and subsume wetlands located kilometers to tens of
   kilometers from the National Wetland Inventory defined lake perimeter.
   As climate across the Prairie Pothole Region is highly variable,

   the key drivers of streamflow in the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental
   Forest (Jencso et al., ; Jencso et al., ), with the goal of creating a
   simple model consistent with internal observations of catchment
   hydrologic connectivity patterns. The model was applied across seven
   catchments located within Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest to
   investigate spatial variability and transferability of model performance
   and parameterization. The results demonstrated that the model resulted
   in historically good fits (based on previous studies at the sites) to
   both the hydrograph and internal water table dynamics (corroborated with
   experimental observations). The impact of a priori parameter limits was
   also examined. It was observed that enforcing field-based limits on
   model parameters resulted in slight reductions to streamflow hydrograph
   fits, but significant improvements to model process fidelity (as
   hydrologic connectivity), as well as moderate improvement in the

Pages = {{90-106}},
Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{Elevation data derived from light detection and ranging present
   challenges for hydrologic modeling as the elevation surface includes
   bridge decks and elevated road features overlaying culvert drainage
   structures. In reality, water is carried through these structures;
   however, in the elevation surface these features impede modeled overland
   surface flow. Thus, a hydrologically-enforced elevation surface is
   needed for hydrodynamic modeling. In the Delaware River Basin,
   hydrologic-enforcement techniques were used to modify elevations to
   simulate how constructed drainage structures allow overland surface
   flow. By calculating residuals between unfilled and filled elevation
   surfaces, artificially pooled depressions that formed upstream of
   constructed drainage structure features were defined, and elevation
   values were adjusted by generating transects at the location of the
   drainage structures. An assessment of each hydrologically-enforced
   drainage structure was conducted using field-surveyed culvert and bridge
   coordinates obtained from numerous public agencies, but it was
   discovered the disparate drainage structure datasets were not
   comprehensive enough to assess all remotely located depressions in need
   of hydrologic-enforcement. Alternatively, orthoimagery was interpreted
   to define drainage structures near each depression, and these locations
   were used as reference points for a quantitative hydrologic-enforcement
   assessment. The orthoimagery-interpreted reference points resulted in a
   larger corresponding sample size than the assessment between
   hydrologic-enforced transects and field-surveyed data. This assessment
   demonstrates the viability of rules-based hydrologic-enforcement that is
   needed to achieve hydrologic connectivity, which is valuable for
   hydrodynamic models in sensitive coastal regions. Hydrologic-enforced
   elevation data are also essential for merging with
   topographic/bathymetric elevation data that extend over vulnerable
   urbanized areas and dynamic coastal regions.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrologic connectivity between hillslopes and streams impacts the
   geomorphological evolution of catchments. Here, we propose a conceptual
   model for hydrogeomorphological evolution of the Susquehanna Shale Hills
   Critical Zone Observatory (SSHCZO), a first-order catchment developed on
   shale in central Pennsylvania, U.S.A. At SSHCZO, the majority of
   available water (the difference between incoming meteoric water and
   outgoing evapotranspiration) flows laterally to the catchment outlet as
   interflow, while the rest is transported by regional groundwater flow.
   Interflow, shallow hillslope flow, is limited to the upper 5 to 8 m of
   highly fractured bedrock, thought to have formed during periglacial
   conditions in the late Pleistocene. In contrast, groundwater flowpaths
   are influenced by the primary permeability of the varying stratigraphic
   units. Both flowpaths respond to weathering-related secondary
   permeability. O-2-rich interflow mixes with deep O-2-poor groundwater
   under the catchment outlet at depths of 5-8 m. Penetration of this
   oxygenated interflow under the valley results in pyrite oxidation,
   release of sulfuric acid, dissolution of minerals, and weakening of
   bedrock. This is hypothesized to enhance channel incision and, in turn,
   to promote drainage of deep groundwater from the ridges. Drainage
   subsequently lowers the catchment water table, advancing the cascade of
   reactions that produce regolith. Weathering in the catchment is
   characterized by both sharp and diffuse reaction fronts. Relatively
   sharp fronts (pyrite, carbonate) mark where vertical, unsaturated flow
   changes to horizontal, saturated flow, while diffuse fronts (illite,
   chlorite, feldspar) mark where flow is largely vertical and unsaturated.
   According to this model, catchment morphology reflects subsurface pyrite
   reactions due to mixing of interflow and groundwater flow under the
   valley floor that ultimately results in clay weathering and regolith
   production nearer the land surface.}},

Abstract = {{Theory predicts that the number of fish species increases with river
   size in natural free-flowing rivers, but the relationship is lost under
   intensive exploitation of water resources associated with dams and/or
   landscape developments. In this paper, we aim to identify orthomorphic
   issues that disrupt theoretical species patterns based on a multi-year,
   basin-wide assessment in the Danshuei River Watershed of Taiwan. We
   hypothesize that multiple human-induced modifications fragment habitat
   areas leading to decreases of local fish species richness. We integrally
   relate natural and anthropogenic influences on fish species richness by
   a multiple linear regression model that is driven by a combination of
   factors including river network structure controls, water quality
   alterations of habitat, and disruption of channel connectivity with
   major discontinuities in habitat caused by dams. We found that stream
   order is a major forcing factor representing natural influence on fish
   species richness. In addition to stream order, we identified dams,
   dissolved oxygen deficiency ( DO), and excessive total phosphorus (TP)
   as major anthropogenic influences on the richness of fish species. Our
   results showed that anthropogenic influences were operating at various
   spatial scales that inherently regulate the physical, chemical, and
   biological condition of fish habitats. Moreover, our probability-based
   risk assessment revealed causes of species richness reduction and
   opportunities for mitigation. Risks of species richness reduction caused
   by dams were determined by the position of dams and the contribution of
   tributaries in the drainage network. Risks associated with TP and DO
   were higher in human-activity-intensified downstream reaches. Our
   methodology provides a structural framework for assessing changes in
   basin-wide fish species richness under the mixed natural and
   human-modified river network and habitat conditions. Based on our
   analysis results, we recommend that a focus on landscape and riverine
   habitats and maintaining long-term monitoring programs are crucial for
   effective watershed management and river conservation plans. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Thresholds and hydrologic connectivity associated with runoff processes
   are a critical concept for understanding catchment hydrologic response
   at the event timescale. To date, most attention has focused on single
   runoff response types, and the role of multiple thresholds and flow path
   connectivities has not been made explicit. Here we first summarise
   existing knowledge on the interplay between thresholds, connectivity and
   runoff processes at the hillslope-small catchment scale into a single
   figure and use it in examining how runoff response and the catchment
   threshold response to rainfall affect a suite of runoff generation
   mechanisms in a small agricultural catchment. A 1.37 ha catchment in the
   Lang Lang River catchment, Victoria, Australia, was instrumented and
   hourly data of rainfall, runoff, shallow ground-water level and isotope
   water samples were collected. The rainfall, runoff and antecedent soil
   moisture data together with water levels at several shallow piezometers
   are used to identify runoff processes in the study site. We use isotope
   and major ion results to further support the findings of the hydrometric
   data. We analyse 60 rainfall events that produced 38 runoff events over
   two runoff seasons. Our results show that the catchment hydrologic
   response was typically controlled by the Antecedent Soil Moisture Index
   and rainfall characteristics. There was a strong seasonal effect in the
   antecedent moisture conditions that led to marked seasonal-scale changes
   in runoff response. Analysis of shallow well data revealed that
   streamflows early in the runoff season were dominated primarily by
   saturation excess overland flow from the riparian area. As the runoff
   season progressed, the catchment soil water storage increased and the
   hillslopes connected to the riparian area. The hillslopes transferred a
   significant amount of water to the riparian zone during and following
   events. Then, during a particularly wet period, this connectivity to the
   riparian zone, and ultimately to the stream, persisted between events
   for a period of 1 month. These findings are supported by isotope results
   which showed the dominance of pre-event water, together with significant
   contributions of event water early (rising limb and peak) in the event
   hydrograph. Based on a combination of various hydrometric analyses and
   some isotope and major ion data, we conclude that event runoff at this
   site is typically a combination of subsurface event flow and saturation
   excess overland flow. However, during high intensity rainfall events,
   flashy catchment flow was observed even though the soil moisture
   threshold for activation of subsurface flow was not exceeded. We
   hypothesise that this was due to the activation of infiltration excess
   overland flow and/or fast lateral flow through preferential pathways on
   the hillslope and saturation overland flow from the riparian zone.}},

   mapped impoundments associated with roads or agricultural land use
   across the Amazon's Curua-Una basin and identified landscape factors
   correlated with each type of impoundment. Impoundments were widespread,
   and deforestation and the land use changes it facilitated was the
   driving factor underlying their creation. We found, on average, one
   impoundment per 7.5 stream kilometers, or 3 km(2), of deforested land, a
   concentration significantly higher than in areas of native forest, which
   had an average of one impoundment per 117 stream kilometers or 100
   km(2). Continuing to slow deforestation and agricultural conversion
   would reduce new agricultural impoundments and conditions facilitating
   soil erosion and subsequent impoundments at road-stream crossings. If
   Brazil's Forest Code can be effectively enforced, it could contribute
   substantially to slowing down deforestation and restoring areas already
   affected. There is an additional need for incentives for sustainable
   agricultural practices that directly reduce impacts to streams and
   remove in-stream cattle water impoundments. These possible solutions to
   address stream alterations would be strengthened by regulatory oversight
   for watershed management in the Amazon basin through implementation of
   existing Brazilian water laws, which could provide the groundwork for
   better valuing aquatic resources in the world's largest freshwater
   ecosystem. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater dynamics play an important role in runoff generation and
   hydrologic connectivity between hillslopes and streams. We monitored a
   network of 14 shallow groundwater (GW) wells in a 3.2km(2) experimental
   catchment in the Scottish Highlands. Wells were placed in three
   contrasting landscape units with different hydropedological
   characteristics and different topographic positions relative to the
   stream network, encompassing a catena sequence from freely draining
   podzols on steeper hillslopes to increasingly thick peats (histosols) in
   the valley bottom riparian zone. GW dynamics were characterized by
   statistical analyses of water table fluctuations, estimation of
   variabilities in lag times and hysteresis response in relation to
   streamflow. The three landscape units had distinct storage-discharge
   relationships and threshold responses with a certain GW level above
   which lateral flow dominates. Steeper hillslopes with freely draining
   podzols were characterized by GW fluctuations of around 150cm in the
   underlying drift. GW usually showed peak response up to several hours
   after stream flow. During persistent wet periods the water table
   remained in the soil profile for short spells and connected shallow flow
   paths in the near surface horizons to the lower hillslopes. In the peaty
   gleys in the lower foot slopes, GW was characterized by a water table
   generally within 20cm of the soil surface, though at some locations this
   could fall to 50cm in extreme dry periods. GW responses were usually a
   few hours prior to the stream responses. In riparian peats, the water
   table was also usually less than 20cm deep and responded several hours
   before the stream. These riparian peat soils remain at, or very near
   saturation with near-continuous GW-surface water connectivity. In
   contrast, the steeper slopes remain disconnected for prolonged periods
   and need large recharge events to overcome storage thresholds. GW
   responses vary seasonally, and landscape controls on the spatial
   organization of GW dynamics are strongest at low flows and in small
   events. During wettest periods, limited storage and extensive saturation
   weaken such controls. This study demonstrated that montane catchments
   can have highly dynamic GW stores, which are important in generating
   both storm flows and baseflows. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons,

   and hydrogeology impact stream hydraulics, ecology, biogeochemical

   floods are rare. We conducted five sets of experimental floods to mimic
   floodplain reconnection by pumping stream water onto an existing
   floodplain swale. Floods were conducted throughout the year to capture
   seasonal variation and each involved two replicate floods on successive
   days to test the effect of varying antecedent moisture. Water levels and
   specific conductance were measured in surface water, soil, and
   groundwater within the floodplain, along with surface flow into and out
   of the floodplain. Vegetation density varied seasonally and controlled
   the volume of surface water storage on the floodplain. By contrast,
   antecedent moisture conditions controlled storage of water in floodplain
   soils, with drier antecedent moisture conditions leading to increased
   subsurface storage and slower flood wave propagation across the
   floodplain surface. The site experienced spatial heterogeneity in
   vertical connectivity between surface water and groundwater across the
   floodplain surface, where propagation of hydrostatic pressure,
   preferential flow, and bulk Darcy flow were all mechanisms that may have
   occurred during the five floods. Vertical connectivity also increased
   with time, suggesting higher frequency of floodplain inundation may
   increase surface water-groundwater exchange across the floodplain
   surface. Understanding the variability of floodplain impacts on water
   quality noted in the literature likely requires better accounting for

   many large river floodplains and, in particular, the local scale factors

   short-term rates of sediment deposition from 2012 to 2014 on floodplain

   Cross-floodplain distributary channels served as particularly important
   conduits for moving sediment onto the floodplain. Physical and chemical

Abstract = {{Few high-elevation tropical catchments worldwide are gauged, and even
   fewer are studied using combined hydrometric and isotopic data.
   Consequently, we lack information needed to understand processes
   governing rainfall-runoff dynamics and to predict their influence on
   downstream ecosystem functioning. To address this need, we present a
   combination of hydrometric and water stable isotopic observations in the
   wet Andean paramo ecosystem of the Zhurucay Ecohydrological Observatory
   (7.53km(2)). The catchment is located in the Andes of south Ecuador
   between 3400 and 3900ma.s.l. Water samples for stable isotopic analysis
   were collected during 2years (May 2011-May 2013), while rainfall and
   runoff measurements were continuously recorded since late 2010. The
   isotopic data reveal that andosol soils predominantly situated on
   hillslopes drain laterally to histosols (Andean paramo wetlands) mainly
   located at the valley bottom. Histosols, in turn, feed water to creeks
   and small rivers throughout the year, establishing hydrologic
   connectivity between wetlands and the drainage network. Runoff is
   primarily composed of pre-event water stored in the histosols, which is
   replenished by rainfall that infiltrates through the andosols.
   Contributions from the mineral horizon and the top of the fractured
   bedrock are small and only seem to influence discharge in small
   catchments during low flow generation (non-exceedance flows<Q(35)).
   Variations in source contributions are controlled by antecedent soil
   moisture, rainfall intensity, and duration of rainy periods. Saturated
   hydraulic conductivity of the soils, higher than the year-round low
   precipitation intensity, indicates that Hortonian overland flow rarely
   occurs during high-intensity precipitation events. Deep groundwater
   contributions to discharge seem to be minimal. These results suggest
   that, in this high-elevation tropical ecosystem, (1) subsurface flow is
   a dominant hydrological process and (2) (histosols) wetlands are the
   major source of stream runoff. Our study highlights that detailed
   isotopic characterization during short time periods provides valuable
   information about ecohydrological processes in regions where very few

Abstract = {{Streams in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs) of Antarctica moderate an
   important hydrologic and biogeochemical connection between upland alpine
   glaciers, valley-bottom soils, and lowland closed-basin lakes. Moreover,
   MDV streams are simple but dynamic systems ideal for studying
   interacting hydrologic and ecological dynamics. This work synthesizes
   20years of hydrologic data, collected as part of the MDVs Long-Term
   Ecological Research project, to assess spatial and temporal dynamics of
   hydrologic connectivity between glaciers, streams, and lakes. Long-term
   records of stream discharge (Q), specific electrical conductance (EC),
   and water temperature (T) from 18 streams were analysed in order to
   quantify the magnitude, duration, and frequency of hydrologic
   connections over daily, annual, and inter-annual timescales. At a daily
   timescale, we observe predictable diurnal variations in Q, EC, and T. At
   an annual timescale, we observe longer streams to be more intermittent,
   warmer, and have higher median EC values, compared to shorter streams.
   Longer streams also behave chemostatically with respect to EC, whereas
   shorter streams are more strongly characterized by dilution.
   Inter-annually, we observe significant variability in annual runoff
   volumes, likely because of climatic variability over the 20 record years
   considered. Hydrologic connections at all timescales are vital to stream
   ecosystem structure and function. This synthesis of hydrologic
   connectivity in the MDVs provides a useful end-member template for
   assessing hydrologic connectivity in more structurally complex temperate

Abstract = {{We combined high-frequency dissolved organic matter fluorescence (FDOM)
   data with stable isotope observations to identify the sources and ages

   (DOC) within a peat-dominated Scottish catchment. FDOM was strongly
   correlated (r(2) similar to 0.8) with DOC, allowing inference of a 15
   min time series. We captured 34 events over a range of hydrological
   conditions. Along with marked seasonality, different event responses
   were observed during summer depending on dry or wet antecedent
   conditions. The majority of events exhibited anticlockwise hysteresis as
   a result of the expansion of the riparian saturation zone, mobilizing
   previously unconnected DOC sources. Water ages from the main runoff
   sources were extracted from a tracer-aided hydrological model.
   Particularly useful were ages of overland flow, which were negatively
   correlated with DOC concentration. Overland flow age, which ranged
   between 0.2 and 360 days, reflected antecedent conditions, with younger
   water generally mobilizing the highest DOC concentrations in summer
   events. During small events with dry antecedent conditions, DOC response
   was proportionally higher due to the displacement and mixing of small
   volumes of previously unconnected highly concentrated riparian soil
   waters by new precipitation. During large events with wet antecedent
   conditions, the riparian saturation zone expands to organic layers on
   the hillslopes causing peaks in DOC. However, these peaks were limited

   high-frequency DOC measurements with other tracers, allowing the effects

Abstract = {{Abandoned channels are those channels left behind as meandering rivers
   migrate over their floodplains and remain among the most enigmatic
   features of the riverscape, especially related to their hydraulics and
   geomorphology. Abandoned channels are being considered and implemented
   as restoration and rehabilitation strategies for large rivers but we do
   not yet have a sound understanding of their hydromorphodynamics. The
   overall objectives of this work were to assess the bed morphology and
   flow structure of a large, dynamically connected abandoned channel
   (e.g., the channel is inundated during annual or decadal floods through
   bank overflow) under varying stages. Here we document the
   hydromorphodynamics of an abandoned channel during 3.4, 9.2, and 37.9
   return interval discharges using an acoustic Doppler current profiler.
   Flow separation was observed along the channel entrance during the
   lowest flow surveying campaign but was not seen during the higher flow
   campaign. Width to depth ratio and channel width at the exit both
   progressively decreased from the first surveying campaign, despite the
   final campaign having the highest measured discharge. Large zones of
   flow stagnation and recirculation were observed, with depth-averaged
   velocity vectors not aligning in one direction, in the abandoned channel
   where water from the entrance was meeting water coming up from the exit
   during moderate discharges. The abandoned channel has been maintained
   for at least 25 years due to its low diversion angle and it being
   perched above the Kansas River. Results of this study provide insights

Abstract = {{The input of leaf litter from riparian vegetation could be affected by
   changes in precipitation and modifications to the hydrological regime.
   We analyse the pattern of leaf litterfall at the community scale as well
   as the breakdown rate in a mixed gallery forest that covers the levees
   of the Parana River oxbow lake. Litterfall was collected biweekly for 4
   years that represents different rainfall and hydrologic regimes of the
   Parana River including flood and prolonged drought: 1996-1997 (PA),
   1999-2000 (PB), 2005-2006 (PC) and 2007-2008 (PD). To analyse leaf
   breakdown, litter bags were incubated on the forest floor during
   flooding conditions (FFo) and dry conditions (DFo) and in the oxbow lake
   (FOx). The total annual leaf litterfall were 8.97, 11.15, 10.42 and
   14.43 tn ha(-1) yr(-1) for PA, PB, PC and PD, respectively. Our results
   suggest that with the increasing severity of the dry season and
   decreasing hydrologic connectivity, the annual leaf litterfall
   increases, whereas its seasonal pattern does not change. Regardless of
   the seasonal pattern of rainfall and hydrological regime in each study
   period, leaf fall occurred throughout the year, and the peak was
   recorded between August and October. Leaves decomposed fastest in FOx,
   and the leaf breakdown on the forest floor was slower during flooding
   conditions than in dry conditions. Regular floods are natural
   occurrences that do not affect the leaf production of the Parana mixed

Abstract = {{On 1 June 2014 (03:35 UTC), an M-w 3.2 earthquake occurred in Weld
   County, Colorado, a historically aseismic area of the Denver-Julesburg
   basin. Weld County is a prominent area of oil and gas development,
   including many high-rate class II wastewater injection wells. In the
   days following the earthquake, the University of Colorado, with support
   from the U.S. Geological Survey and Incorporated Research Institutions
   for Seismology-Portable Array Seismic Studies of the Continental
   Lithosphere, rapidly deployed six seismic stations to characterize the
   seismicity associated with the 1 June earthquake (the Greeley sequence)
   and to investigate its possible connection to wastewater disposal. The
   spatial and temporal proximity of earthquakes to a high-rate wastewater
   disposal well strongly suggests these earthquakes were induced.
   Scientific communication between the university, state agencies, and the
   energy industry led to rapid mitigation strategies to reduce the
   occurrence of further earthquakes. Mitigation efforts included
   implementing a temporary moratorium on injection at the well, cementing
   the bottom portion of the disposal well to minimize hydrologic
   connectivity between the disposal formation and the underlying
   crystalline basement, and subsequently allowing injection to resume at
   lower rates. Following the resumption of wastewater disposal,
   microseismicity was closely monitored for both increases in earthquake
   rate and magnitude. Following mitigation efforts, between 13 August 2014
   and 29 December 2015, no earthquakes larger than M 1.5 occurred near the
   Greeley sequence. This study demonstrates that a detailed and rapid
   characterization of a seismic sequence in space and time relative to
   disposal, combined with collaboration and communication between

Abstract = {{Periodic releases from an upstream dam cause rapid stage fluctuations in
   the Lower Colorado River near Austin, Texas, USA. These daily pulses
   modulate fluid exchange and residence times in the hyporheic zone where
   biogeochemical reactions are typically pronounced. The effects of a
   small flood pulse under low-flow conditions on surface-water/groundwater
   exchange and biogeochemical processes were studied by monitoring and
   sampling from two dense transects of wells perpendicular to the river.
   The first transect recorded water levels and the second transect was
   used for water sample collection at three depths. Samples were collected
   from 12 wells every 2 h over a 24-h period which had a 16-cm flood
   pulse. Analyses included nutrients, carbon, major ions, and stable
   isotopes of water. The relatively small flood pulse did not cause
   significant mixing in the parafluvial zone. Under these conditions, the
   river and groundwater were decoupled, showed potentially minimal mixing
   at the interface, and did not exhibit any discernible denitrification of
   river-borne nitrate. The chemical patterns observed in the parafluvial
   zone can be explained by evaporation of groundwater with little mixing
   with river water. Thus, large pulses may be necessary in order for
   substantial hyporheic mixing and exchange to occur. The large regulated
   river under a low-flow and small flood pulse regime functioned mainly as
   a gaining river with little hydrologic connectivity beyond a narrow
   hyporheic zone.}},

Abstract = {{Best management practices (BMPs) are increasingly being promoted as a
   solution to the potentially adverse effects agriculture can have on
   aquatic systems. However, the ability of BMPs to improve riverine
   systems continues to be questioned due to equivocal empirical evidence
   linking BMP use with improved stream conditions, particularly in regard
   to ecological conditions. Explicitly viewing BMP location in relation to
   hydrological pathways may, however, assist in establishing stronger
   ecological linkages. The goal of this study was to assess the
   association between water chemistry, benthic macroinvertebrate community
   structure, and the number and location of agricultural BMPs in a
   catchment. Macroinvertebrate and water samples were collected in 30
   small (< 12 km(2)) catchments exhibiting gradients of BMP use and
   location in the Grand River Watershed, Southern Ontario, Canada.
   Stepwise regression analysis revealed that concentrations of most stream
   nutrients declined in association with greater numbers of BMPs and
   particularly when BMPs were located in hydrologically connected areas.
   However, BMPs were significantly associated with only one metric (\%EPT)
   describing macroinvertebrate community structure. Furthermore, variance
   partitioning analysis indicated that less than 5 \% of the among site
   variation in the macroinvertebrate community could be attributed to
   BMPs. Overall, the implemented BMPs appear to be achieving water quality
   improvement goals but spatial targeting of specific BMP types may allow
   management agencies to attain further water quality improvements more
   efficiently. Mitigation and rehabilitation measures beyond the BMPs
   assessed in this study may be required to meet goals of enhanced
   ecological condition.}},

Abstract = {{Global mean sea levels may rise between 0.75 and 1.9 m by 2100 changing
   the distribution and community structure of coastal ecosystems due to
   flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion. Although habitats will be
   inundated, ecosystems have the potential to shift inland, and endemic
   species may persist if conditions are favorable. Predictions of
   ecosystem migration due to sea level rise need to account for current
   stressors, which may reduce the resilience of these ecosystems. This
   study predicts the potential consequences of sea level rise on the
   groundwater-fed anchialine pool ecosystem in Hawaii. Scenarios of marine
   and groundwater inundation were compared with current patterns of
   habitat, introduced fishes, and land use. Results show that current
   habitats containing endemic anchialine shrimp will be increasingly
   inundated by marine waters. New habitats will emerge in areas that are
   low lying and undeveloped. Because of subsurface hydrologic
   connectivity, endemic shrimp are likely to populate these new habitats
   by moving through the coastal aquifer. In some areas, rising sea levels
   will provide surface connectivity between pools currently containing
   introduced fishes (tilapia, poeciliids) and up to 46 \% of new or
   existing pools that do not contain these fish. Results predicting future
   habitat distribution and condition due to sea level rise will support
   conservation planning. Additionally, the interdisciplinary approach may

Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Excess nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from human activities have
   contributed to degradation of coastal waters globally. A growing body of
   work suggests that hydrologically restoring streams and rivers in
   agricultural and urban watersheds has potential to increase N and P
   retention, but rates and mechanisms have not yet been analyzed and
   compared across studies. We conducted a review of nutrient retention
   within hydrologically reconnected streams and rivers, including 79
   studies. We developed a typology characterizing different forms of
   stream and river restoration, and we also analyzed nutrient retention
   across this typology. The studies we reviewed used a variety of methods
   to analyze nutrient cycling. We performed a further intensive meta
   -analysis on nutrient spiraling studies because this method was the most
   consistent and comparable between studies. A meta -analysis of 240
   experimental additions of ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3), and soluble
   reactive phosphorus (SRP) was synthesized from 15 nutrient spiraling
   studies. Our results showed statistically significant relationships
   between nutrient uptake in restored streams and specific watershed
   attributes. Nitrate uptake metrics were significantly related to
   watershed surface area, impervious surface cover, and average reach
   width (p < 0.05). Ammonium uptake metrics were significantly related to
   discharge, velocity, and transient storage (p < 0.05). SRP uptake
   metrics were significantly related to watershed area, discharge, SRP
   concentrations, and chl a concentrations (p < 0.05). Given that most
   studies were conducted during baseflow, more research is necessary to
   characterize nutrient uptake during high flow. Furthermore, long-term
   studies are needed to understand changes in nutrient dynamics as
   projects evolve over time. Overall analysis suggests the size of the
   stream restoration (surface area), hydrologic connectivity, and
   hydrologic residence time are key drivers influencing nutrient retention
   at broader watershed scales and along the urban watershed continuum.}},

Abstract = {{The Prairie Pothole Region of North America is characterized by
   numerous, small, wetland depressions that perform important ecological
   and hydrological functions. Recent studies have shown that total wetland
   area in the region is decreasing due to cumulative impacts related to
   natural and anthropogenic changes. The impact of wetland losses on
   landscape hydrology is an active area of research and management.
   Various spatially distributed hydrologic models have been developed to
   simulate effects of wetland depression storage on peak river flows,
   frequently using dated geospatial wetland inventories. We describe an
   innovative method for identifying wetland depressions and quantifying
   their nested hierarchical bathymetric/topographic structure using
   high-resolution light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. This contour
   tree method allows identified wetland depressions to be quantified based
   on their dynamic filling-spilling-merging hydrological processes. In
   addition, wetland depression properties, such as surface area, maximum
   depth, mean depth, storage volume, etc., can be computed for each
   component of a depression as well as the compound depression. We
   successfully applied the proposed method to map wetland depressions in
   the Little Pipestem Creek watershed in North Dakota. The methods
   described in this study will provide more realistic and higher
   resolution data layers for hydrologic modeling and other studies
   requiring characterization of simple and complex wetland depressions,
   and help prioritize conservation planning efforts for wetland resources.}},

Abstract = {{Riyadh, the capital of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, has experienced
   unusual levels of urbanization in the past few decades, making it one of
   the fastest growing cities in the world. This paper examines flood
   hazards in the rapidly urbanizing catchment of Al-Aysen in Riyadh.
   Remote sensing and geographic information system techniques were
   employed to obtain and prepare input data for hydrologic and hydraulic
   models, with the former based on the very popular curve number approach.
   Due to the limited nature of the rainfall data, observations from two
   rain gauges in the vicinity of the catchment were used to estimate
   design storms. The hydrologic model was run in a semi-distributed mode
   by dividing the catchment into many sub-catchments. The impact of
   urbanization on run-off volume and peak discharge resulting from
   different storms was investigated, with various urbanization scenarios
   simulated. Flood hazard zones and affected streets were also identified
   through hydrologic/hydraulic model simulation. The mismatch between
   administrative and catchment boundaries can create problems in flood
   risk management for similar cities since hydrologic processes and flood
   hazards are based on the hydrologic connectivity. Since flooding events
   impact the road network and create driving hazards, governmental
   decision-makers must take the necessary precautions to protect drivers
   in these situations.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrologic connectivity provisions water and nutrient subsidies to
   floodplain wetlands and may be particularly important in floodplains
   with seasonal water deficits through its effects on soil moisture. In
   this study, we measured sapflow in 26 trees of two dominant floodplain
   forest species (Celtis laevigata and Quercus lyrata) at two
   hydrologically distinct sites in the lower White River floodplain in
   Arkansas, USA. Our objective was to investigate how connectivity-driven
   water table variations affected water use, an indicator of tree
   function. Meteorological variables (photosynthetically active radiation
   and vapor pressure deficit) were the dominant controls over water use at
   both sites; however, water table variations explained some site
   differences. At the wetter site, highest sapflow rates were during a
   late-season overbank flooding event, and no flood stress was apparent.
   At the drier site, sapflow decreased as the water table receded. The
   late-season flood pulse that resulted in flooding at the wetter site did
   not affect the water table at the drier site; accordingly, higher water
   use was not observed at the drier site. The species generally associated
   with wetter conditions (Q. lyrata) was more positively responsive to the
   flood pulse. Flood water subsidy lengthened the effective growing
   season, demonstrating ecological implications of hydrologic connectivity
   for alleviating water deficits that otherwise reduce function in this

Abstract = {{Hydrological connectivity regulates the structure and function of
   Amazonian freshwater ecosystems and the provisioning of services that
   sustain local populations. This connectivity is increasingly being
   disrupted by the construction of dams, mining, land-cover changes, and
   global climate change. This review analyzes these drivers of
   degradation, evaluates their impacts on hydrological connectivity, and
   identifies policy deficiencies that hinder freshwater ecosystem
   protection. There are 154 large hydroelectric dams in operation today,
   and 21 dams under construction. The current trajectory of dam
   construction will leave only three free-flowing tributaries in the next
   few decades if all 277 planned dams are completed. Land-cover changes
   driven by mining, dam and road construction, agriculture and cattle
   ranching have already affected similar to 20\% of the Basin and up to
   similar to 50\% of riparian forests in some regions. Global climate
   change will likely exacerbate these impacts by creating warmer and dryer
   conditions, with less predictable rainfall and more extreme events
   (e.g., droughts and floods). The resulting hydrological alterations are
   rapidly degrading freshwater ecosystems, both independently and via
   complex feedbacks and synergistic interactions. The ecosystem impacts
   include biodiversity loss, warmer stream temperatures, stronger and more
   frequent floodplain fires, and changes to biogeochemical cycles,
   transport of organic and inorganic materials, and freshwater community
   structure and function. The impacts also include reductions in water
   quality, fish yields, and availability of water for navigation, power
   generation, and human use. This degradation of Amazonian freshwater
   ecosystems cannot be curbed presently because existing policies are
   inconsistent across the Basin, ignore cumulative effects, and overlook
   the hydrological connectivity of freshwater ecosystems. Maintaining the
   integrity of these freshwater ecosystems requires a basinwide research
   and policy framework to understand and manage hydrological connectivity
   across multiple spatial scales and jurisdictional boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{Study region: Karst watershed in Lower Flint River Basin (LFRB),

   Study focus: Baseflow discharges in the LFRB have declined for three
   decades as regional irrigation has increased; yet, the location and
   nature of connectivity between groundwater and surface water in this
   karstic region are poorly understood. Because growing water demands will
   likely be met by further development of regional aquifers, an important
   management concern is the nature of interactions between groundwater and
   surface water components under natural and anthropogenic perturbations.
   We conducted coarse and fine-scale stream sampling on a major tributary
   of the Lower Flint River (Ichawaynochaway Creek) in southwestern
   Georgia, USA, to identify locations and patterns of enhanced hydrologic
   connectivity between this stream and the Upper Floridan Aquifer.
   New hydrological insights for the region: Prior water resource studies
   in the LFRB were based on regional modeling that neglected local
   heterogeneities in groundwater/surface water connectivity. Our results
   demonstrated groundwater inputs were concentrated around five of fifty
   sampled reaches, evidenced by increases in multiple groundwater
   indicators at these sites. These five reaches contributed up to 42\% of
   the groundwater detected along the entire 50-km sampling section, with
   24\% entering through one groundwater-dominated tributary,
   Chickasawhatchee Creek. Intermittent flows occurred in two of these
   upstream reaches during extreme drought and heavy groundwater pumping,
   suggesting reach-scale behaviors should be considered in resource

Abstract = {{Geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs), those surrounded by uplands,
   exchange materials, energy, and organisms with other elements in
   hydrological and habitat networks, contributing to landscape functions,
   such as flow generation, nutrient and sediment retention, and
   biodiversity support. GIWs constitute most of the wetlands in many North
   American landscapes, provide a disproportionately large fraction of
   wetland edges where many functions are enhanced, and form complexes with
   other water bodies to create spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the
   timing, flow paths, and magnitude of network connectivity. These
   attributes signal a critical role for GIWs in sustaining a portfolio of
   landscape functions, but legal protections remain weak despite
   preferential loss from many landscapes. GIWs lack persistent surface
   water connections, but this condition does not imply the absence of
   hydrological, biogeochemical, and biological exchanges with nearby and
   downstream waters. Although hydrological and biogeochemical connectivity
   is often episodic or slow (e.g., via groundwater), hydrologic continuity
   and limited evaporative solute enrichment suggest both flow generation
   and solute and sediment retention. Similarly, whereas biological
   connectivity usually requires overland dispersal, numerous organisms,
   including many rare or threatened species, use both GIWs and downstream
   waters at different times or life stages, suggesting that GIWs are
   critical elements of landscape habitat mosaics. Indeed, weaker
   hydrologic connectivity with downstream waters and constrained
   biological connectivity with other landscape elements are precisely what
   enhances some GIW functions and enables others. Based on analysis of
   wetland geography and synthesis of wetland functions, we argue that
   sustaining landscape functions requires conserving the entire continuum
   of wetland connectivity, including GIWs.}},

Abstract = {{Recent climate change has reduced the spatial extent and thickness of
   permafrost in many discontinuous permafrost regions. Rapid permafrost
   thaw is producing distinct landscape changes in the Taiga Plains of the
   Northwest Territories, Canada. As permafrost bodies underlying forested
   peat plateaus shrink, the landscape slowly transitions into unforested
   wetlands. The expansion of wetlands has enhanced the hydrologic
   connectivity of many watersheds via new surface and near-surface flow
   paths, and increased streamflow has been observed. Furthermore, the
   decrease in forested peat plateaus results in a net loss of boreal
   forest and associated ecosystems. This study investigates fundamental
   processes that contribute to permafrost thaw by comparing observed and
   simulated thaw development and landscape transition of a peat
   plateau-wetland complex in the Northwest Territories, Canada from 1970
   to 2012. Measured climate data are first used to drive surface energy
   balance simulations for the wetland and peat plateau. Near-surface soil
   temperatures simulated in the surface energy balance model are then
   applied as the upper boundary condition to a three-dimensional model of
   subsurface water flow and coupled energy transport with freeze-thaw.
   Simulation results demonstrate that lateral heat transfer, which is not
   considered in many permafrost models, can influence permafrost thaw
   rates. Furthermore, the simulations indicate that landscape evolution
   arising from permafrost thaw acts as a positive feedback mechanism that
   increases the energy absorbed at the land surface and produces
   additional permafrost thaw. The modeling results also demonstrate that
   flow rates in local groundwater flow systems may be enhanced by the
   degradation of isolated permafrost bodies.}},

Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. Relatively high -diversity among aquatic insect communities
   inhabiting high-elevation streams is most commonly presumed to result
   from increased dispersal limitation between isolated mountaintop
   islands'. However, these elevational patterns of -diversity have been
   predominately drawn from observed changes in community composition along
   single-thread channels, where the downstream increase in habitat size
   and hydrologic connectivity provides potential alternative explanations.
   2. In this study, we applied an alternative conceptual tributary model'
   to ask whether patterns of aquatic insect -diversity in similar-sized,
   hydrologically disconnected streams showed a similar elevational
   gradient in diversity patterns as previously reported for conceptual
   mainstem model' studies. Aquatic insects were sampled from 24 low-order,
   montane streams that are tributaries to larger rivers in three adjacent
   catchments spanning c. 2000-3500m in elevation. We used relative
   abundance data to quantify two types of -diversity: (i) community
   turnover-, or the change in local diversity among adjacent streams along
   the elevational gradient within each catchment, and (ii) community
   variation-, or the change in local diversity among all streams within
   three elevation zones combined across catchments.
   3. Our results provided evidence of no relationship between -diversity
   and elevation in aquatic insect communities in small montane streams.
   Community turnover- was found to be consistently high among sites within
   catchments and displayed no significant trend across the elevational
   gradient for any catchment. Community variation- showed a nonlinear
   response to elevation, with sites in the high-elevation and
   low-elevation zones having similarly high community variation- compared
   to sites in the mid-elevation zone.
   4. Our tributary model' results provide the first evidence that
   -diversity among small, isolated streams can have similar turnover rates
   across broad elevational gradients. Our results also show similar
   patterns of -diversity among low- and high-elevation tributaries,
   suggesting that dispersal limitation is not restricted to high-elevation
   streams.}},

Abstract = {{Lateral surface/subsurface flow and their connectivity play a
   significant role in redistributing soil water, which has a direct effect
   on biological, chemical, and geomorphological processes in the root zone
   (similar to 1m). However, most of the land surface models neglect the
   horizontal exchanges of water at the grid or subgrid scales, focusing
   only on the vertical exchanges of water as one-dimensional process. To
   develop better hydrologic understanding and modeling capability in
   complex landscapes, in this study we added connectivity-based lateral
   subsurface flow algorithms in the Community Land Model. To demonstrate
   the impact of lateral flow and connectivity on soil water storage we
   designed three cases including the following: (1) with complex surface
   topography only, (2) with complex surface topography in upper soil
   layers and soil hydraulic properties with uniform anisotropy. and (3)
   with complex surface topography and soil hydraulic properties with
   spatially varying anisotropy. The connectivity was considered as an
   indicator for the variation of anisotropy in the case 3, which was
   created by wetness conditions or geophysical controls (e.g., soil type,
   normalized difference vegetation index, and topographic index). These
   cases were tested in two study sites (ER 5 field and ER-sub watershed in
   Oklahoma) comparing to the field (gravimetric and remote sensing) soil
   moisture observations. Through the analysis of spatial patterns and
   temporal dynamics of soil moisture predictions from the study cases,
   surface topography was found to be a crucial control in demonstrating
   the variation of near surface soil moisture, but not significantly
   affected the subsurface flow in deeper soil layers. In addition, we
   observed the best performance in case 3 representing that the lateral
   connectivity can contribute effectively to quantify the anisotropy and
   redistributing soil water in the root zone. Hence, the approach with
   connectivity-based lateral subsurface flow was able to better
   characterize the spatially distributed patterns of subsurface flow and
   improve the simulation of the hydrologic cycle.}},

Title = {{MEASURING LONGITUDINAL RIVER NETWORK CONNECTIVITY}},
Booktitle = {{11TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ECOHYDRAULICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Rivers are amongst the most endangered systems in the world. They suffer
   a multitude of pressures that act at various temporal and spatial
   scales. Longitudinal connectivity reduction is one of the most severe
   impacts forced upon river networks. Transversal barriers, such as dams,
   break up the original network into several sub-networks, promoting
   species and populations' isolation by limiting fish movements which
   might lead to genetic bottlenecks and loss of populations. These impacts
   exist worldwide and there is a need for numerical tools that help to
   understand the extent of the impacts and facilitate correct allocation
   of resources for restoration actions. Thus, this work aims at measuring
   the impact of connectivity reduction on the distribution of freshwater
   fish species and to quantify overall river network connectivity. To
   achieve these objectives several habitat suitability modeling techniques
   and a spatial graph approach were employed. We were able to assess the
   impact of barriers placement on the structural and functional
   connectivity of river networks - using both resident and migratory fish
   species; and also to develop a technique that allows the overall
   connectivity of a given network to be quantified. This technique is
   further useful to aid decision-making by prioritizing barriers to
   intervene and enhance connectivity and to determine where to place new
   instream barriers reducing overall connectivity impacts.}},

Pages = {{410-416}},
Abstract = {{Surface water and groundwater quality in areas of South Africa continues
   to be degraded by acid mine drainage (AMD), a legacy of coal mining. The
   majority of abandoned coal mines consist of complex multiple level
   workings connected to a drainage tunnel discharging AMD, in lower lying
   regions. This decanting mine water poses severe problems to the
   receiving environment. Thus, there is a need, to define hydrologic
   connectivity between surface water, groundwater and mine workings to
   understand the source of both water and contaminants at the decanting
   points. South Africa has limited studies into the feasibility of using
   tracer techniques, especially in mine water studies to understand
   underground water dynamics. Locally, there are no regulations and/or
   standard procedures for such activities. Wolkersdorfer (2008), states
   that in some countries such as Germany, there are regulations that
   govern the use of tracers.
   In a case study that is currently in progress as part of the use of
   tracers in mine water, water samples were collected from different
   discharge points in and around a flooded and abandoned coal mine, within
   the Witbank coal fields of the Permian Karoo Supergroup. This was done
   to classify the different water types as a pre-assessment for using
   tracer techniques. Our preliminary results demonstrated that the water
   samples collected have high concentrations of major elements such as
   SO4, Cl, Na, Mg, Al, K, and Ca.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{The transfer of parameter sets over different temporal and spatial
   resolutions is common practice in many large-domain hydrological
   modelling studies. The degree to which parameters are transferable
   across temporal and spatial resolutions is an indicator of how well
   spatial and temporal variability is represented in the models. A large
   degree of transferability may well indicate a poor representation of
   such variability in the employed models. To investigate parameter
   transferability over resolution in time and space we have set up a study
   in which the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model for the Thur
   basin in Switzerland was run with four different spatial resolutions
   (1kmx 1km, 5kmx -5km, 10km x 10km, lumped) and evaluated for three
   relevant temporal resolutions (hour, day, month), both applied with
   uniform and distributed forcing. The model was run 3150 times using the
   Hierarchical Latin Hypercube Sample and the best 1\% of the runs was
   selected as behavioural. The overlap in behavioural sets for different
   spatial and temporal resolutions was used as an indicator of parameter
   transferability. A key result from this study is that the overlap in
   parameter sets for different spatial resolutions was much larger than
   for different temporal resolutions, also when the forcing was applied in
   a distributed fashion. This result suggests that it is easier to
   transfer parameters across different spatial resolutions than across
   different temporal resolutions. However, the result also indicates a
   substantial underestimation in the spatial variability represented in
   the hydrological simulations, suggesting that the high spatial
   transferability may occur because the current generation of large-domain
   models has an inadequate representation of spatial variability and
   hydrologic connectivity. The results presented in this paper provide a
   strong motivation to further investigate and substantially improve the
   representation of spatial and temporal variability in large-domain
   hydrological models.}},

Abstract = {{Shallow subsurface flow is a dominant process controlling hillslope

   Despite their importance, the location and geometry of these flow paths
   are difficult to determine. In arctic environments, shallow subsurface
   flow paths are limited to a thin zone of seasonal thaw above permafrost,
   which is traditionally assumed to mimic the surface topography. We have
   used a combined approach of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and
   self-potential (SP) measurements to map shallow subsurface flow paths in
   and around water tracks, drainage features common to arctic hillslopes.
   ERT measurements delineate thawed zones in the subsurface that control
   flow paths, whereas SP is sensitive to groundwater flow. We have found
   that areas of low electrical resistivity in the water tracks were deeper
   than manual thaw depth estimates and varied from the surface topography.
   This finding suggests that traditional techniques might underestimate
   active-layer thaw and the extent of the flow path network on arctic

Abstract = {{Geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs) are characterized as isolated'
   because they are embedded by uplands, though they potentially exhibit a
   gradient of hydrologic, biological, or chemical connections to other
   surface waters. In fact, recent field studies have begun to elucidate
   that GIWs exhibit varying degrees of hydrologic connectivity. In this
   study, we examine the influence of GIWs on streamflow, a potential
   indicator of GIW hydrologic connectivity with surface waters. We assess
   annual and seasonal spatially based statistical relationships between
   GIW characteristics (e.g. volume and extent) and streamflow across a
   dense network of subbasins using a hybrid modeling approach. Our method
   involves the Spatial Stream Network (SSN) model, which considers spatial
   autocorrelation of model covariates explicitly, and the Soil and Water
   Assessment Tool (SWAT), which predicts streamflow across a network of
   579 subbasins in the lower Neuse River Basin, North Carolina, USA. Our
   study results suggest that GIWs, to some extent, influence streamflow.
   The further GIWs are from a stream, the greater their capacity to
   increase streamflow due to the physiographic setting, hypothesized
   transit times, and sequencing of watershed hydrologic connectivity in
   the study area. However, as the combined extent of GIWs and non-GIWs
   increases in subbasins, seasonal and annual streamflow decreases.
   Results also suggest that other landscape indicators of watershed-scale
   hydrology can, in aggregate with GIWs and non-GIWs, explain variations
   in seasonal and annual simulated streamflow. Our study findings begin to
   elucidate the aggregate influence of GIWs on streamflow, providing
   insights for future decision-making on GIW protection and management.

Abstract = {{Because of their large numbers and biogeochemical activity, small water
   bodies (SWB), such as ponds and wetlands, can have substantial
   cumulative effects on hydrologic, biogeochemical and biological
   processes, yet the spatial distributions of various SWB types are often
   unknown, especially in modified landscapes. Using updated National
   Wetland Inventory data, we compare the spatial distribution of SWB types
   across various ecoregions and land covers within the state of Indiana.
   Of 203942 total SWB, 75\% contain a permanent water feature and 80\% of
   those SWB are classified as excavated or impounded ponds. Both
   underlying geology and human modifications influence SWB distributions.
   Wetlands are most prevalent in the agricultural Drift Plain and are
   larger with a greater range of sizes than man-made open water features.
   Small impoundment ponds dominate the southern forested region of the
   Interior Plateau. Analysis of variance of slopes from power law
   distributions confirms differences between SWB distributions in the
   Drift Plain and the Interior Plateau as well as differences between
   forested wetlands and diked and excavated open waters across ecoregions.
   SWB densities are lowest in the Corn Belt regions and in agriculture
   overall. SWB in urban lands tend to have higher median area than natural
   or agricultural lands and have intermediate densities. This analysis
   highlights the presence of hydrological modifications in SWB
   distributions, namely the potential legacy of wetland removal and pond
   creation practices in the state. Determining these modified
   distributions and patterns is the first step in understanding cumulative
   SWB influences on various ecological processes in modified landscapes.

   The topographic index of connectivity (IC) of Borselli et al. (2008) was
   computed for the Loire-Brittany River Basin (> 10(5) km(2)). A
   distributed parameter (IDPR) that reflects landscape infiltration and
   saturation properties due to underlying geological formation
   characteristics is introduced. We integrated this parameter in a revised
   index (IC (revised) ) as an indicator of landscape hydrologic
   connectivity. Results at the pixel scale are aggregated at the watershed
   scale.
   Two maps of connectivity are produced, considering the initial IC and
   the revised form (IC (revised) ). As expected, the IC gives the highest
   connectivity in the steepest areas and does not reflect the existing
   connectivity in lowland areas. On the contrary, the IC (revised)
   computed in this study profoundly modifies the sediment connectivity
   values. These changes are evenly distributed over the entire territory
   and affected 51.5 \% of the watersheds. As a result, we obtained a
   better correlation between calculated connectivity and the observed
   drainage density (which reflects the actual connections between
   hillslopes and rivers) in areas where slopes are gentle (< 7 \%).
   Topographic indices do not reflect the real sediment connectivity in
   lowland areas, but their adaptation by considering runoff processes of
   such areas is possible. The IC (revised) presents an interesting
   perspective to define other highly connected areas at the country scale,
   as 17 \% of the French territory is characterized by very gentle slopes
   with high runoff capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding landscape influences on stream ecosystems is a challenging
   task due to the spatial complexity and connectedness of stream networks.
   Here, we control for longitudinal connectivity to provide a robust test
   of the relative importance of reach-and catchment-scale factors in
   determining macroinvertebrate community structure in southwestern
   Pennsylvania streams. We determined that sites separated by <= 510 m
   along the stream network had significantly correlated macroinvertebrate
   community scores. After controlling for this spatial autocorrelation, a
   partial least squares regression identified two factors that together
   accounted for 32\% of the variation in community scores. In this model,
   two reach-scale factors-habitat assessment score and stream pH-were the
   most important factors for predicting a stream's macroinvertebrate
   community score. However, landscape diversity was also important.
   Landscape diversity is a catchment-scale factor that was highly
   correlated with percent pasture/hay and measures of habitat
   fragmentation. Our results provide support for the idea that stream
   communities in undisturbed areas are heavily influenced by reach-scale
   characteristics. Furthermore, our results indicate that Pennsylvania
   natural resource managers should consider habitat score and stream pH
   after accounting for spatial autocorrelation when identifying
   restoration targets for impacted streams.}},

Abstract = {{Wetland creation has become a commonplace method for mitigating the loss
   of natural wetlands. Often mitigation projects fail to restore ecosystem
   services of the impacted natural wetlands. One of the key ecosystem
   services of newly created wetlands is carbon accumulation/sequestration,
   but little is known about how planting diversity (PD) affects the
   ability of herbaceous wetland plants to store carbon in newly created
   wetlands. Most mitigation projects involve a planting regime, but PD,
   which may be critical in establishing biologically diverse and
   ecologically functioning wetlands, is seldom required. Using a set of 34
   mesocosms (similar to 1 m(2) each), we investigated the effects of
   planting diversity on carbon storage potential of four native wetland
   plant species that are commonly planted in created mitigation wetlands
   in Virginia Carex vulpinoidea, Eleocharis obtusa, Juncus effusus, and
   Mimulus ringens. The plants were grown under the four distinctive PD
   treatments {[}i.e., monoculture (PD 1) through four different species
   mixture (PD 4)]. Plant biomass was harvested after two growing seasons
   and analyzed for tissue carbon content. Competition values (CV) were
   calculated to understand how the PD treatment affected the competitive
   ability of plants relative to their biomass production and thus carbon
   storage potentials. Aboveground biomass ranged from 988 g/m(2) - 1515
   g/m(2), being greatest in monocultures, but only when compared to the
   most diverse mixture (p = 0.021). However, carbon storage potential
   estimates per mesocosm ranged between 344 g C/m(2) in the most diverse
   mesocosms (PD 4) to 610 g C/m(2) in monoculture ones with no significant
   difference (p = 0.089). CV of E. obtusa and C. vulpinoidea showed a
   declining trend when grown in the most diverse mixtures but J. effusus
   and M. ringens displayed no difference across the PD gradient (p =
   0.910). In monocultures, both M. ringens, and J. effusus appeared to
   store carbon as biomass more effectively than the other species,
   suggesting that the choice of plant species may play an important role
   in facilitating the development of carbon accumulation/storage in
   created wetlands. Plant community diversity provides many ecosystem
   services (e.g., habitat and floristic quality) other than carbon storage
   function. Thus, a further study is needed that will focus on
   investigating how other design elements such as microtopography and
   hydrologic connectivity may interact with PD in terms of enhancing the
   carbon storage potential of newly created wetlands. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An understanding of the factors controlling the permanent and episodic
   links between the main stem of a river and the ecosystems of its
   alluvial floodplain is necessary for evaluating the influence of modern
   river processes on floodplain ecology and habitat diversity and for the
   successful implementation of flow regimes that meet human needs for
   water in a manner that sustains the ecological integrity of affected
   systems. In this study, we examined relationships between river
   hydrology and lateral hydrological connectivity, which is crucial to
   directing fluxes of water, material, and organisms into and across a
   floodplain. We did so by translating measures of river discharge for the
   Congaree River into high resolution maps of flood conditions for the
   floodplain at Congaree National Park using a 2D flood inundation model.
   Utilizing a graph network approach, we then analyzed the connectivity of
   a key wetland ecosystem, Taxodium-Nyssa forested swamps, to the main
   stem river and to each other under different flows. Our results
   underscore that floodplain connectivity is initiated at sub-bankfull
   discharges and does not depend on levee overtopping, while also
   clarifying that various sources of connectivity are triggered at
   different flow levels in specific reaches. Further, our findings
   demonstrate the sensitive and non-linear response of floodplain
   connectivity to river flows and provide useful information to facilitate
   the management of flood processes in the Congaree River watershed.

Abstract = {{Strong reciprocal interactions exist between landscape patterns and
   ecological processes. In wetlands, hydrology is the dominant abiotic
   driver of ecological processes and both controls, and is controlled, by
   vegetation presence and patterning. We focus on binary patterning in the
   Everglades ridge-slough landscape, where longitudinally connected flow,
   principally in sloughs, is integral to landscape function. Patterning
   controls discharge competence in this low-gradient peatland, with
   important feedbacks on hydroperiod and thus peat accretion and patch
   transitions.
   To quantitatively predict pattern effects on hydrologic connectivity and
   thus hydroperiod.
   We evaluated three pattern metrics that vary in their hydrologic
   specificity. (1) Landscape discharge competence considers elongation and
   patch-type density that capture geostatistical landscape features. (2)
   Directional connectivity index (DCI) extracts both flow path and
   direction based on graph theory. (3) Least flow cost (LFC) is based on a
   global spatial distance algorithm strongly analogous to landscape water
   routing, where ridges have higher flow cost than sloughs because of
   their elevation and vegetation structure. Metrics were evaluated in
   comparison to hydroperiod estimated using a numerically intensive
   hydrologic model for synthetic landscapes. Fitted relationships between
   metrics and hydroperiod for synthetic landscapes were extrapolated to
   contemporary and historical maps to explore hydroperiod trends in space
   and time.
   Both LFC and DCI were excellent predictors of hydroperiod and useful for
   diagnosing how the modern landscape has reorganized in response to
   modified hydrology.
   Metric simplicity and performance indicates potential to provide
   hydrologically explicit, computationally simple, and spatially
   independent predictions of landscape hydrology, and thus effectively
   measure of restoration performance.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial community assembly and microbial functions are affected by a
   number of different but coupled drivers such as local habitat

   groundwater systems, hydrological flow can introduce spatial structure
   and directional dependencies among these drivers. We examined the
   importance of hydrology in structuring bacterial communities and their
   function within two alpine floodplains during different hydrological
   states. Piezometers were installed in stream sediments and surrounding
   riparian zones to assess hydrological flows and also were used as
   incubation chambers to examine bacterial community structures and

   hydrologically-driven processes influencing bacterial assemblages and

   activities. The effect of hydrology on bacterial community structure was
   considerably less strong, suggesting that assemblages demonstrate large

Abstract = {{Background: Snow and ice melt provide sensitive indicators of climate
   change and serve as the primary source of stream flow in alpine basins.
   Aims: We synthesise the results of hydrological and hydrochemical
   studies during the period 1995-2014, building on a long history of
   earlier work focused on snow and water on Niwot Ridge and the adjacent
   Green Lakes Valley (GLV), which is part of the Niwot Ridge Long Term
   Ecological Research site (NWT LTER).
   Methods: These studies are discussed in the context of how snow,
   snowmelt and runoff reflect changing local climate. We review recent
   results of snow, snowmelt, hydrology and hydrochemistry from the plot to
   the basin scale, utilising new tools such as continuous global
   positioning system (GPS) measurements of snow depth, along with
   remotely-sensed measurements of snow-covered area and melt, combined
   with long-term measurements of snow properties, discharge and solute and
   isotopic content of water.
   Results and Conclusions: Surface-groundwater interactions are important
   components of water quantity and quality in alpine basins. Some or most
   snowmelt infiltrates underlying soils and bedrock, transporting soil and
   bedrock products to surface waters. Infiltrating snowmelt, along with
   increased melt of stored ice, increases the hydrologic connectivity
   between the terrestrial and aquatic systems. Alpine basins are being
   impacted by increases in atmospheric nitrogen deposition, which has
   caused changes in soil microbial processes such as nitrification.
   Nitrate, dissolved organic carbon and dissolved organic nitrogen are
   thus flushed from soils and talus to streams. Our long-term results show
   that alpine catchments, such as Green Lake 4 at NWT LTER+, have the
   greatest sensitivity and least resilience to climate warming, with any
   warming leading to increased water yields.}},

Abstract = {{The European eel is a panmictic species, whose decline has been recorded
   since the last 30 years. Among human-induced environmental factors of
   decline, the impact of water dams during species migration is
   questioned. Indeed, water impoundments can be a severe obstacle for
   young eels trying to reach the upstream freshwater zones, even if they
   are equipped with fish-friendly passes. The passage by such devices
   could be an important event shaping the outcome of the future life and
   life history traits of eels. We studied what phenotypic traits were
   associated with the event of experience of passage by water obstacles.
   We analyzed specific enzyme activities and/or gene transcription levels
   in the muscle and brain to test whether the obstacle passage is rather a
   physical or cognitive task. We found that after a long period of
   maintenance under homogenous conditions, transcription levels of several
   genes linked to synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis and thyroid activity
   differed among the field-experience groups. In contrast, muscle gene
   transcription levels or enzymatic activities did not show any
   differences among fish groups. We suggest that cognitive processes such

   metabolic capacities are involved in passage of water obstacles by young
   eels. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural practices have altered watershed-scale dissolved organic
   matter (DOM) dynamics, including in-stream concentration,
   biodegradability, and total catchment export. However, mechanisms
   responsible for these changes are not clear, and field-scale processes
   are rarely directly linked to the magnitude and quality of DOM that is
   transported to surface water. In a small (12 ha) agricultural catchment
   in eastern Washington State, we tested the hypothesis that hydrologic
   connectivity in a catchment is the dominant control over the
   concentration and quality of DOM exported to surface water via
   artificial subsurface drainage. Concentrations of dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) and humic-like components of DOM decreased while the
   Fluorescence Index and Freshness Index increased with depth through the
   soil profile. In drain discharge, these characteristics were
   significantly correlated with drain flow across seasons and years, with
   drain DOM resembling deep sources during low-flow and shallow sources
   during high flow, suggesting that DOM from shallow sources bypasses
   removal processes when hydrologic connectivity in the catchment is
   greatest. Assuming changes in streamflow projected for the Palouse River
   (which contains the study catchment) under the A1B climate scenario
   (rapid growth, dependence on fossil fuel, and renewable energy sources)

   driest years. This study highlights the variability in DOM inputs from
   agricultural soil to surface water on daily to interannual time scales,
   pointing to the need for a more nuanced understanding of agricultural

Abstract = {{Geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs) are defined as wetlands that are
   completely surrounded by uplands. While GIWs are therefore spatially
   isolated, field-based studies have observed a continuum of hydrologic
   connections between these systems and other surface waters. Yet few
   studies have quantified the watershed-scale aggregate effects of GIWs on
   downstream hydrology. Further, existing modeling approaches to evaluate
   GIW effects at a watershed scale have utilized conceptual or spatially
   disaggregated wetland representations. Working towards wetland model
   representations that use spatially explicit approaches may improve
   current scientific understanding concerning GIW effects on the
   downstream hydrograph. The objective of this study was to quantify the
   watershed-scale aggregate effects of GIWs on downstream hydrology while
   emphasizing a spatially explicit representation of GIWs and GIW
   connectivity relationships. We constructed a hydrologic model for a
   similar to 202 km(2) watershed in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina,
   USA, a watershed with a substantial population of GIWs, using the Soil
   and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). We applied a novel representation of
   GIWs within the model, facilitated by an alternative hydrologic response
   unit (HRU) definition and modifications to the SWAT source code that
   extended the model's ``pothole{''} representation. We then executed a
   series of scenarios to assess the downstream hydrologic effect of
   various distributions of GIWs within the watershed. Results suggest
   that: (1) GIWs have seasonally dependent effects on baseflow; (2) GIWs
   mitigate peak flows; and (3) The presence of GIWs on the landscape
   impacts the watershed water balance. This work demonstrates a means of
   GIW simulation with improved spatial detail while showing that GIWs,
   in-aggregate, have a substantial effect on downstream hydrology in the
   studied watershed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A hydrologic connectivity index for jurisdictional analysis of headwater
   streams in a montane watershed}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{187}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A hydrologic connectivity index (HCI) was developed to aid the US Clean
   Water Act Section 404 jurisdictional evaluation of headwater streams in
   montane watersheds, using the Cement Creek Watershed in the San Juan
   Mountains, Colorado as a case study. Jurisdictional determinations are
   required for many intermittent and ephemeral streams, where significant
   nexus with downstream traditional navigable waters (TNWs) must be
   evaluated. Three biophysical metrics (a streamflow metric, distance from
   the stream to the TNW, and slope between the stream and the TNW) for 239
   streams in the watershed were used to develop three indices. These were
   then combined to develop the HCI, which is a compound, additive index.
   There was a large range of HCI values for ephemeral streams, which all
   require a significant nexus evaluation to determine jurisdiction.
   Statistical analysis of HCI values across stream duration and order
   classes showed that mean values differed significantly among classes.
   The flow index component constituted the greatest proportion of the HCI
   for perennial streams, was sensitive to the flow metrics used, and was
   greatest for high flows. Although ephemeral streams are only connected
   to the TNW less than 3 months of the year, the cumulative average annual
   flow contribution of ephemeral first-order streams can be 5 \% of the
   total to the TNW, and their flow contribution is larger during high
   flows. Some ephemeral streams with high HCI values are farthest from the
   TNW but contribute the greatest flow out of all ephemeral reaches, and
   may have significant nexus with the river. The study shows that the HCI
   can be useful for initial evaluation of connectivity, significant nexus,
   and jurisdiction of headwaters at the watershed scale.}},

Title = {{Geographically Isolated Wetlands: Why We Should Keep the Term}},
Journal = {{WETLANDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{997-1003}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Use of the term ``isolated wetlands{''} in the U.S. Supreme Court's
   SWANCC decision created confusion, since it could imply functional
   isolation. In response, the term ``geographically isolated wetlands{''}
   (GIWs) - wetlands surrounded by uplands - was introduced in 2003. A
   recent article revisits the term, concluding that it is a misnomer that
   adds to the confusion. Hydrogeomorphic (HGM) type and non-adjacency to
   jurisdictional waters are suggested as alternatives. To address this
   issue, I pose two questions: is there a need to identify wetlands
   surrounded by uplands and what to call them? Regarding the former, there
   is a legal/regulatory need resulting from the Court's Rapanos decision:
   to help determine whether such wetlands have a significant nexus with
   traditional navigable waters. There is also a scientific need to
   understand how the normal lack of surface water connectivity affects
   function. Regarding the second question, neither HGM type nor
   non-adjacency adequately identifies wetlands surrounded by uplands. I
   contend that ``GIW{''} remains the most informative option. However, the
   term needs to be applied properly and researchers should emphasize that
   being surrounded by uplands does not imply hydrological or biological
   isolation. Further, conclusions from one GIW type should be extrapolated
   to other GIWs with great care.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed information about coastal inundation is vital to understanding
   dynamic and populated areas that are impacted by storm surge and
   flooding. To understand these natural hazard risks, lidar elevation
   surfaces are frequently used to model inundation in coastal areas. A
   single-value surface method is sometimes used to inundate areas in lidar
   elevation surfaces that are below a specified elevation value. However,
   such an approach does not take into consideration hydrologic
   connectivity between elevation grids cells resulting in inland areas
   that should be hydrologically connected to the ocean, but are not.
   Because inland areas that should drain to the ocean are hydrologically
   disconnected by raised features in a lidar elevation surface, simply
   raising the water level to propagate coastal inundation will lead to
   inundation uncertainties. We took advantage of this problem to identify
   hydrologically disconnected inland areas to point out that they should
   be considered for coastal inundation, and that a lidar-based hydrologic
   surface should be developed with hydrologic connectivity prior to
   inundation analysis. The process of achieving hydrologic connectivity
   with hydrologic-enforcement is not new, however, the application of
   hydrologically-enforced lidar elevation surfaces for improved coastal
   inundation mapping as approached in this research is innovative. In this
   article, we propagated a high-resolution lidar elevation surface in
   coastal Staten Island, New York to demonstrate that inland areas lacking
   hydrologic connectivity to the ocean could potentially be included in
   inundation delineations. For inland areas that were hydrologically
   disconnected, we evaluated if drainage to the ocean was evident, and
   calculated an area exceeding 11 ha (similar to 0.11 km(2)) that could be
   considered in inundation delineations. We also assessed land cover for
   each inland area to determine the type of physical surfaces that would
   be potentially impacted if the inland areas were considered as part of a
   coastal inundation. A visual analysis indicated that developed, medium
   intensity and palustrine forested wetland land cover types would be
   impacted for those locations. This article demonstrates that hydrologic
   connectivity is an important factor to consider when inundating a lidar
   elevation surface. This information is needed for inundation monitoring
   and management in sensitive coastal regions.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{To assess the influence of storage dynamics and nonlinearities in
   hydrological connectivity on time-variant stream water ages, we used a
   new long-term record of daily isotope measurements in precipitation and
   streamflow to calibrate and test a parsimonious tracer-aided runoff
   model. This can track tracers and the ages of water fluxes through and
   between conceptual stores in steeper hillslopes, dynamically saturated
   riparian peatlands, and deeper groundwater; these represent the main
   landscape units involved in runoff generation. Storage volumes are
   largest in groundwater and on the hillslopes, though most dynamic mixing
   occurs in the smaller stores in riparian peat. Both streamflow and
   isotope variations are generally well captured by the model, and the
   simulated storage and tracer dynamics in the main landscape units are
   consistent with independent measurements. The model predicts that the
   average age of stream water is similar to 1.8 years. On a daily basis,
   this varies between similar to 1 month in storm events, when younger
   waters draining the hillslope and riparian peatland dominates, to around
   4 years in dry periods when groundwater sustains flow. This variability
   reflects the integration of differently aged water fluxes from the main
   landscape units and their mixing in riparian wetlands. The connectivity
   between these spatial units varies in a nonlinear way with storage that
   depends upon precipitation characteristics and antecedent conditions.
   This, in turn, determines the spatial distribution of flow paths and the
   integration of their contrasting nonstationary ages. This approach is
   well suited for constraining process-based modeling in a range of
   northern temperate and boreal environments.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation is an important cause of biodiversity loss in
   freshwater systems, as worldwide rivers have been fragmented by dams and
   other hydraulic structures. To restore freshwater fish populations, some
   barriers have been removed, but the long-term ecological effects of this
   removal have been rarely quantified. In the present study, we quantified
   the effects of barrier removal on river colonization by anadromous sea
   lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) by analyzing the spatial distribution and
   nest density in a small coastal river (France) from 1994 to 2011. Our
   results demonstrated the benefit of dam removal within few years after
   restoration. Indeed, the spatial distribution of nests shifted
   significantly upstream and was more uniform throughout the river after
   removal. Our results also suggest that the spatial patterns of habitat
   colonization were affected by the density of nests, river flow and
   connectivity. Finally, although the number of nests was significantly
   higher after removal, it was not possible to clearly identify the
   contribution of intrinsic versus external factors involved in this
   pattern. Further investigations are therefore needed to quantify the

Abstract = {{Photosynthesis and respiration are primary drivers of dissolved oxygen
   dynamics in rivers. We measured dissolved oxygen dynamics, aquatic
   ecosystem metabolism, algal abundance and nutrient concentrations at
   main channel and backwater sites on a reach of the Upper Mississippi
   River that borders the states of Wisconsin and Minnesota (U.S.A.). We
   asked (i) how ecosystem metabolism rates, dissolved oxygen dynamics and

   (ii) whether ecosystem metabolism relates to solar irradiance, nutrient
   concentration, algal abundance, temperature and river discharge and
   (iii) whether the relationships between ecosystem metabolism and these
   environmental factors differs between the main channel and backwaters.
   The rates of aquatic ecosystem metabolism in the main channel were among
   the highest reported for large rivers. Mean daily gross primary
   production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R) and net ecosystem production
   (NEP) in the main channel in the 2006 growing season were 10, 6 and 4g

   temperature, rather than nutrients, accounted for most temporal
   variability in gross primary production (GPP). Discharge was negatively
   associated with GPP in the main channel and temperature positively
   associated with GPP in backwaters. Primary production consistently
   exceeded respiration in the main channel in summer, resulting in
   persistent oxygen supersaturation from late June to early August.
   Maximum chlorophyll concentrations (140g L-1) were observed in the main
   channel, rather than the backwaters. Nitrogen and phosphorus exhibited
   contrasting temporal patterns in backwaters probably reflecting

Abstract = {{Catchment land uses, particularly agriculture and urban uses, have long
   been recognized as major drivers of nutrient concentrations in surface
   waters. However, few simple models have been developed that relate the
   amount of catchment land use to downstream freshwater nutrients. Nor are
   existing models applicable to large numbers of freshwaters across broad
   spatial extents such as regions or continents. This research aims to
   increase model performance by exploring three factors that affect the
   relationship between land use and downstream nutrients in freshwater:
   the spatial extent for measuring land use, hydrologic connectivity, and
   the regional differences in both the amount of nutrients and effects of
   land use on them. We quantified the effects of these three factors that
   relate land use to lake total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) in
   346 north temperate lakes in 7 regions in Michigan, USA. We used a
   linear mixed modeling framework to examine the importance of spatial
   extent, lake hydrologic class, and region on models with individual lake
   nutrients as the response variable, and individual land use types as the
   predictor variables. Our modeling approach was chosen to avoid problems
   of multi-collinearity among predictor variables and a lack of
   independence of lakes within regions, both of which are common problems
   in broad-scale analyses of freshwaters. We found that all three factors
   influence land use-lake nutrient relationships. The strongest evidence
   was for the effect of lake hydrologic connectivity, followed by region,
   and finally, the spatial extent of land use measurements. Incorporating
   these three factors into relatively simple models of land use effects on
   lake nutrients should help to improve predictions and understanding of
   land use-lake nutrient interactions at broad scales.}},

Abstract = {{Many of the scientific and societal challenges in understanding and
   preparing for global environmental change rest upon our ability to
   understand and predict the water cycle change at large river basin,
   continent, and global scales. However, current large-scale land models
   (as a component of Earth System Models, or ESMs) do not yet reflect the
   best hydrologic process understanding or utilize the large amount of
   hydrologic observations for model testing. This paper discusses the
   opportunities and key challenges to improve hydrologic process
   representations and benchmarking in ESM land models, suggesting that (1)
   land model development can benefit from recent advances in hydrology,
   both through incorporating key processes (e.g., groundwater-surface
   water interactions) and new approaches to describe multiscale spatial
   variability and hydrologic connectivity; (2) accelerating model advances
   requires comprehensive hydrologic benchmarking in order to
   systematically evaluate competing alternatives, understand model
   weaknesses, and prioritize model development needs, and (3) stronger
   collaboration is needed between the hydrology and ESM modeling
   communities, both through greater engagement of hydrologists in ESM land
   model development, and through rigorous evaluation of ESM hydrology
   performance in research watersheds or Critical Zone Observatories. Such
   coordinated efforts in advancing hydrology in ESMs have the potential to

   hillslope-riparian study area in the Panola Mountain Research Watershed,
   Georgia, USA, were examined with respect to the occurrence of perched
   groundwater and groundwater flow directions. A connected groundwater
   table was taken as an indication of a hydrologic connection between the
   hillslope and the stream. Flow directions were determined based on
   observed water levels at different combinations of three neighbouring
   wells. The analyses indicated that the hillslope was disconnected from
   the stream most of the time but that almost the entire hillslope became
   connected to the stream during large rainfall events. This coincided
   with more sustained streamflow during these events. There were clear
   differences in the timing of the groundwater response between the upper
   hillslope, lower hillslope and riparian zone, with water levels near the
   stream and on the upper hillslope rising earlier than on the midslope.
   The flow directions were generally downslope and were most variable
   around a bedrock depression on the midslope. On the hillslope, the
   direction of the water table followed the local bedrock topography when
   the water level was low at the start and end of an event and the overall
   surface topography when water levels were high. In the riparian zone,
   flow directions either did not change significantly during events or
   turned from a more downstream (i.e. downvalley) direction to a more

Abstract = {{The closure problem of representing hydrological boundary fluxes given
   the state of the system has been described as the scientific Holy Grail'

   hysteretic and scale dependent because of the differences between
   velocities and celerities in a hydrological systemeffectively velocities
   are storage controlled, and celerities are controlled by storage
   deficits. To improve our understanding of the nature of these
   relationships a new hydrology model is used (the Multiple Interacting
   Pathways or MIPs model) to explore the influence of catchment scale on
   storage-flow-transport relationships, and their non-linearities. The
   MIPs model has been shown to produce acceptable simulations of both flow
   and tracer, i.e. of both celerities and velocities, at the Gardsjon

   versions of the Gardsjon catchment to allow us for the first time to

Abstract = {{Continental precipitation not routed to the oceans as runoff returns to
   the atmosphere as evapotranspiration. Partitioning this
   evapotranspiration flux into interception, transpiration, soil
   evaporation, and surface water evaporation is difficult using
   traditional hydrological methods, yet critical for understanding the
   water cycle and linked ecological processes. We combined two large-scale
   flux-partitioning approaches to quantify evapotranspiration
   subcomponents and the hydrologic connectivity of bound, plant-available
   soil waters with more mobile surface waters. Globally, transpiration is
   64 +/- 13\% (mean +/- 1 standard deviation) of evapotranspiration, and
   65 +/- 26\% of evaporation originates from soils and not surface waters.
   We estimate that 38 +/- 28\% of surface water is derived from the
   plant-accessed soil water pool. This limited connectivity between soil
   and surface waters fundamentally structures the physical and
   biogeochemical interactions of water transiting through catchments.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated relative influence of climatic variables on the plant
   productivity after lagoon restoration. Chilika Lagoon, the largest
   brackish lake ecosystem in East Asia, experienced severe problems such
   as excessive dominance of freshwater exotic plants and rapid debasement
   of biodiversity associated with decreased hydrologic connectivity
   between the lagoon and the ocean. To halt the degradation of the lagoon
   ecosystem, the Chilika Development Authority implemented a restoration
   project, creating a new channel to penetrate the barrier beach of the
   lagoon. Using a satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index
   (NDVI) dataset, we compared the trend of vegetation changes after the
   lagoon restoration, from April 1998 to May 2014. The time series of NDVI
   data were decomposed into trend, seasonal, and random components using a
   local regression method. The results were visualized to understand the
   traits of spatial distribution in the lagoon. The NDVI trend, indicative
   of primary productivity, decreased rapidly during the restoration
   period, and gradually increased (slope coefficient: 2.1 x 10(-4), p <
   0.05) after two years of restoration. Level of seawater exchange had
   more influences on plant productivity than local precipitation in the
   restored lagoon. Higher El Nino/Southern Oscillation increased sea level
   pressure, and caused intrusion of seawater into the lagoon, and the
   subsequently elevated salinity decreased the annual mean NDVI. Our
   findings suggest that lagoon restoration plans for enhancing
   interconnectivity with the ocean should consider oceanographic effects
   due to meteorological forcing, and long-term NDVI results can be used as
   a valuable index for adaptive management of the restoration site. (C)

Abstract = {{Predicting runoff source areas and how they change through time is a
   challenge in hydrology. Topographically induced lateral water
   redistribution and water removal through evapotranspiration lead to
   spatially and temporally variable patterns of watershed water storage.
   These dynamic storage patterns combined with threshold mediation of
   saturated subsurface throughflow lead to runoff source areas that are
   dynamic through time. To investigate these processes and their
   manifestation in watershed runoff, we developed and applied a
   parsimonious but spatially distributed model (WECOHWatershed
   ECOHydrology). Evapotranspiration was measured via an eddy-covariance
   tower located within the catchment and disaggregated as a function of
   vegetation structure. This modeling approach reproduced the stream
   hydrograph well and was internally consistent with observed watershed
   runoff patterns and behavior. We further examined the spatial patterns
   of water storage and their evolution through time by building on past
   research focused on landscape hydrologic connectivity. The percentage of
   landscape area connected to the stream network ranged from less than 1\%
   during the fall and winter base flow period to 71\% during snowmelt.
   Over the course of the 2 year study period, 90\% of the watershed areas
   were connected to the stream network for at least 1 day, leaving 10\% of
   area that never became connected. Runoff source areas during the event
   shifted from riparian dominated runoff to areas at greater distances
   from the stream network when hillslopes became connected. Our modeling
   approach elucidates and enables quantification and prediction of
   watershed active areas and those active areas connected to the stream

Abstract = {{Lake water quality is affected by local and regional drivers, including
   lake physical characteristics, hydrology, landscape position, land
   cover, land use, geology, and climate. Here, we demonstrate the utility
   of hypothesis testing within the landscape limnology framework using a
   random forest algorithm on a national-scale, spatially explicit data
   set, the United States Environmental Protection Agency's 2007 National
   Lakes Assessment. For 1026 lakes, we tested the relative importance of
   water quality drivers across spatial scales, the importance of
   hydrologic connectivity in mediating water quality drivers, and how the
   importance of both spatial scale and connectivity differ across response
   variables for five important in-lake water quality metrics (total
   phosphorus, total nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, turbidity, and
   conductivity). By modeling the effect of water quality predictors at
   different spatial scales, we found that lake-specific characteristics
   (e.g., depth, sediment area-to-volume ratio) were important for
   explaining water quality (54-60\% variance explained), and that
   regionalization schemes were much less effective than lake specific
   metrics (28-39\% variance explained). Basin-scale land use and land
   cover explained between 45-62\% of variance, and forest cover and
   agricultural land uses were among the most important basin-scale
   predictors. Water quality drivers did not operate independently; in some
   cases, hydrologic connectivity (the presence of upstream surface water
   features) mediated the effect of regional-scale drivers. For example,
   for water quality in lakes with upstream lakes, regional classification
   schemes were much less effective predictors than lake-specific
   variables, in contrast to lakes with no upstream lakes or with no
   surface inflows. At the scale of the continental United States,
   conductivity was explained by drivers operating at larger spatial scales
   than for other water quality responses. The current regulatory practice
   of using regionalization schemes to guide water quality criteria could
   be improved by consideration of lake-specific characteristics, which
   were the most important predictors of water quality at the scale of the
   continental United States. The spatial extent and high quality of
   contextual data available for this analysis makes this work an
   unprecedented application of landscape limnology theory to water quality
   data. Further, the demonstrated importance of lake morphology over other
   controls on water quality is relevant to both aquatic scientists and

Abstract = {{Hydrologic connectivity is the linkage of separate regions of a
   catchment via water flow. Knowledge of hillslope-stream connectivity
   (both at the surface and in the subsurface) is essential for
   understanding and predicting runoff responses and streamwater quality.
   Connectivity can be very dynamic: hillslopes may connect to the stream
   only during certain events or seasons. While surface connectivity is
   often discussed, particularly in the context of sediment transport,
   subsurface connectivity is more difficult to describe and assess. This
   difficulty has led to a wide variety in methodologies that are used in
   various contexts. Field approaches have focused on intensive monitoring
   of processes on the hillslope or the fingerprint of connectivity in the
   stream. Combining experimental studies with modeling allows for testing
   of hypotheses with respect to thresholds and controls on connectivity,
   and extrapolation from the hillslope scale to the catchment scale.
   However, as most modeling approaches are based on datasets from a few
   intensively studied hillslopes, this carries the inherent risk of
   oversimplification because it assumes that the observed hillslope
   responses are representative for the catchment or even the region.
   Focussed efforts on catchment scale assessment of hillslope-stream
   connectivity, as well as site intercomparisons and the search for
   similarity measures may allow us to capture the wider picture of the
   mechanisms and factors that control hillslope-stream connectivity, and
   its effects on flow and transport at the catchment scale. This overview
   focuses on how hillslope-stream connectivity has been studied and
   describes the advantages, disadvantages, and challenges of the different

Abstract = {{Wetlands provide many ecosystem services, including sediment and carbon

   Although all wetlands are biogeochemical hotspots, geographically
   isolated wetlands (GIWs) receive fewer legal protections compared with
   other types of wetlands because of their apparent isolation from
   jurisdictional waters. Here, we consider controls on biogeochemical
   functions that influence water quality, and estimate changes in
   ecosystem service delivery that would occur if these landscape features
   were lost following recent US Supreme Court decisions (i.e., Rapanos,
   SWANCC). We conclude that, despite their lack of persistent surfacewater
   connectivity or adjacency to jurisdictional waters, GIWs are integral to
   biogeochemical processing on the landscape and therefore maintaining the
   integrity of US waters. Given the likelihood that any GIW contributes to
   downstream water quality, we suggest that the burden of proof could be
   shifted to assuming that all GIWs are critical for protecting aquatic
   systems until proven otherwise.}},

Abstract = {{As managers of agricultural and natural resources are confronted with

   information on specific sub-systems (e.g., land, air, water, and
   economics). An increasing awareness of the unintended consequences of
   management decisions resulting from interconnectedness of these
   sub-systems, however, necessitates coupled regional earth system models
   (EaSMs). Decision makers' needs and priorities can be integrated into
   the model design and development processes to enhance decision-making

   Direct engagement between model developers and non-academic stakeholders

   the model development process is a critical component of this effort.
   BioEarth utilizes a bottom-up approach for its land surface model that

Abstract = {{Recent studies have suggested that the hydrologic connectivity of

   moisture conditions and land cover patterns. A water storage model
   (EWS), based on water levels (WLs), specific yield (Sy) and surface
   elevation (SE) changes, was compared with a basic water budget of a
   small, boreal, patterned fen (13ha) during the ice-free period. Results
   showed that the EWS model reproduced well storage variations derived
   from the water budget. These results suggest that storage variations can
   be properly represented by the fluctuations of WLs when we consider the
   heterogeneous soil properties. However, storage deviations occurred at
   the daily scale and could be explained by a lack of information on water
   retention in unsaturated layers, canopy interceptions and preferential
   flows. Despite the significant impact of SE changes on the different
   peatland cover storage budgets (strings and lawns), using Sy mean values
   had a low impact on storage estimations. This can be explained by the
   large proportion of pools and high WLs throughout the fen. At the fen
   scale, high storage in the pools seemed to reduce the Sy difference
   between strings and lawns. The results of this study provide new
   insights about the complex hydrological behaviour of northern catchments

Abstract = {{Water resources are continually redistributed across international
   borders as a result of virtual water flows associated with global trade,
   where `virtual water' is the term describing water used in the
   production of commodities. This transfer of virtual water allows some
   countries to rely heavily on the water resources of other countries
   without having to transport the water itself. This paper conducts an
   investigation into the relationship between international virtual water
   flows and domestically available renewable water resources for a number
   of countries, to determine trends in national dependencies on foreign
   water resources over time. Countries with similar states of dependence
   are clustered, and changes in these clusters are tracked from 1965 to
   2010 to determine country-specific and global trends. We make use of a
   temporal version of the self-organizing map (SOM), the self-organizing
   time map (SOTM), which provides the means for visualizing structural
   changes in spatiotemporal data. The SOTM is investigated through a
   second-level clustering to visualize emerging, changing and disappearing
   clusters in the data. A post-processing technique is introduced to
   facilitate interpretation of individual country trends on the SOTM. This
   study reveals a global trend towards an increased dependence on foreign
   water resources between 1965 and 2010. The method presented in this
   study is a workflow tool that results in a visualization of countries
   with similar and diverging trends of water resource dependencies. This
   tool can be used to inform national trade, water resources, and
   environmental management decisions which must take international
   hydrologic connectivity into account. The sustainability of current
   virtual water trade and water use trends can be examined with respect to
   the level of water scarcity experienced by individual and groups of

Abstract = {{Freshwater ecosystem health has been increasingly linked to floodplain
   connectivity, and some river restoration efforts now overtly target
   reconnecting floodplain habitats for species recovery. The dynamic
   nature of floodplain habitats is not typically accounted for in efforts
   to plan and evaluate potential floodplain reconnection projects. This
   study describes a novel approach for integrating streamflow dynamics
   with floodplain area to quantify species-specific habitat availability
   using hydraulic modelling, spatial analysis and statistical measures of
   flow regime. We used this hydro-ecological modelling approach to examine
   the potential habitat for splittail (Pogonichthys macrolepidotus),
   Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and their food resources under
   two restoration treatments and two climate change flow scenarios for a
   study site on San Joaquin River in California. Even with the addition of
   new floodplain through restoration efforts, the modelling results reveal
   only 13 streamflow events in the past 80years had the magnitude and
   duration required for splittail spawning and rearing, and 14 events had
   flows long enough for salmon rearing benefits. Under climate change,
   modelled results suggest only 4-17\% of the years in the rest of this
   century are likely to produce required flow-related habitat conditions
   for splittail and salmon rearing along the study reach. Lastly, we
   demonstrate by simulating augmented reservoir releases that restoration
   of fish habitat will require a more natural flow regime to make use of
   restored floodplain and achieve the desired hydrologic habitat

Abstract = {{Understanding heterogeneity or patchiness in the distribution of
   vegetation and retention of C and nutrients in river corridors is
   critical for setting priorities for river management and restoration.
   Several mechanisms of spatial differentiation in nutrient retention in
   river and floodplain corridors have been recognized, but few studies
   have distinguished their relative importance or established their role
   in long-term geomorphic change, nutrient retention, and connectivity
   with downstream systems. We evaluated the ability of 3 mechanisms
   (evapotranspiration focusing {[}EF], differential hydrologic exchange
   {[}DHE], and particulate nutrient redistribution {[}PNR]) to explain
   spatial patterns of P retention and function in the Everglades (Florida,
   USA). We used field measurements in sloughs and on slightly higher, more
   densely vegetated ridges to quantify P fluxes attributable to the 3
   mechanisms. EF does not explain Everglades nutrient retention or P
   concentrations on ridges and in sloughs. However, DHE resulting from
   different periods of groundwater-surface-water connectivity across
   topographic elements is the primary cause of elevated P concentrations
   on ridges and completely explains interpatch differences in long-term P
   accumulation rates. With historical flow velocities, which were an order
   of magnitude higher than at present, PNR would have further increased
   the interpatch difference in long-term P retention rates nearly 2-fold.
   In conclusion, DHE and PNR are the dominant drivers of nutrient
   patchiness in the Everglades and are hypothesized to be important in
   P-limited river and floodplain corridors globally.}},

Abstract = {{Estuarine detritus-based food webs typically rely on diverse sources and
   timing of organic matter (OM) delivery. Access to detritus requires
   adequate hydraulic connectivity for consumer migration into productive
   locations and the transfer of allochthonous detritus into consumer
   habitats. These processes are particularly important to the patterns and
   rates of community development in restoring estuarine marshes where OM
   sources and connectivity might vary as a function of landscape setting.
   This study quantifies trophic dynamics in restoring and natural marsh
   ecosystems in the Skokomish estuary, Washington, USA, using Pacific blue
   mussels (Mytilus trossulus), stable isotopes, and a Bayesian multiple
   source mixing model to estimate available suspended food resources. The
   restoring marshes represent different ages since restoration
   implementation-14 and 3 years-as well as different restoration
   approaches-a levee breach and a full levee removal. Sestonic OM was less
   available and of lower quality in the two restoring marshes than in the
   natural marsh site. Mussel diets tracked seasonal trends in OM
   availability: Phytoplankton consumption was highest in spring, marsh
   detritus consumption was highest in winter (but consistently comprised
   at least 30 \% of OM assimilated by mussels), and macroalgae consumption
   was highest in September. Trophic equivalency with mussels inhabiting
   the natural marsh appears to be restoring more rapidly in the younger
   restoration site, perhaps because increased hydrologic connectivity
   achieved through full levee removal promotes greater OM exchange
   compared to the single levee breach restoration approach. We conclude
   that increasing ecosystem capacity for detritus production by restoring
   emergent marsh ecosystems can bolster support for detritus-based food
   webs and suggest that restoration actions enhancing connectivity may
   achieve functional equivalency more rapidly than restoration projects
   exhibiting limited connectivity to the surrounding landscape.}},

Pages = {{1333-1352}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Increased deposition of reactive atmospheric N has resulted in the
   nitrogen saturation of many forested catchments worldwide. Isotope-based
   studies from multiple forest sites report low proportions
   (mean=approximate to 10\%) of unprocessed atmospheric nitrate in streams
   during baseflow, regardless of N deposition or nitrate export rates.
   Given similar proportions of atmospheric nitrate in baseflow across a
   variety of sites and forest types, it is important to address the
   postdepositional drivers and processes that affect atmospheric nitrate
   transport and fate within catchments. In a meta-analysis of stable
   isotope-based studies, we examined the influence of methodological,
   biological, and hydrologic drivers on the export of atmospheric nitrate
   from forests. The delta O-18-NO3- values in stream waters may increase,
   decrease, or not change with increasing discharge during stormflow
   conditions, and delta O-18-NO3- values are generally higher in stormflow
   than baseflow. However, delta O-18-NO3- values tended to increase with
   increasing baseflow discharge at all sites examined. To explain these
   differences, we present a conceptual model of hydrologic flowpath
   characteristics (e.g., saturation overland flow versus subsurface
   stormflow) that considers the influence of topography on
   landscape-stream hydrologic connectivity and delivery of unprocessed
   atmospheric nitrate to streams. Methodological biases resulting from
   differences in sampling frequency and stable isotope analytical
   techniques may further influence the perceived degree of unprocessed
   atmospheric nitrate export. Synthesis of results from numerous
   isotope-based studies shows that small proportions of unprocessed
   atmospheric nitrate are common in baseflow. However, hydrologic,
   topographic, and methodological factors are important drivers of actual
   or perceived elevated contributions of unprocessed atmospheric nitrate
   to streams.}},

Abstract = {{Although recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings indicate surface hydrologic
   connectivity (SHC) between geographically isolated wetlands and nearby
   streams may be used, in part, to determine wetland jurisdictional
   status, and ecologic implications are considerable regardless of
   policies, wetland-stream SHC has rarely been quantified. Furthermore,
   the impact of cultivation and restoration on wetland-stream SHC is
   largely unknown. To help fill these knowledge gaps, we recorded SHC
   patterns during water year 2010 in non-perennial streams connecting
   Delmarva bay wetlands, which are commonly considered geographically
   isolated, and nearby perennial streams. We also evaluated how hydrologic
   wetland restoration impacts SHC relative to historical wetlands and
   native forested wetlands. Cumulative connection duration, number of
   connectivity transitions, mean connection duration, and maximum
   individual connection duration (D (max-c) ) were quantified. Forested
   wetlands were connected to perennial streams for a greater cumulative
   duration but exhibited fewer connectivity transitions relative to both
   historical and restored wetlands. SHC between historical and restored
   wetlands and nearby perennial streams did not differ with respect to any
   of the calculated metrics. Forested wetland-stream SHC was seasonally
   intermittent, exhibiting stream outflow from mid-fall to late-spring
   during periods of low evapotranspiration and elevated groundwater levels
   but lacking connectivity during summer months when evapotranspiration
   and groundwater were at an annual high and low, respectively. Historical
   and restored wetland-stream SHC was largely ephemeral, occurring in
   response to antecedent rainfall, particularly during winter and spring.
   Stepwise regression models describe cumulative connection duration and D
   (max-c) as a function of wetland, watershed, and non-perennial stream
   metrics including watershed relief, non-perennial stream slope,
   non-perennial stream length, and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity.
   Wetland-stream SHC has potential ecological implications, including
   provision of dispersal corridors for biota, biogeochemical processing of
   nutrients, and downstream delivery of energy, matter, and organisms, and
   is currently tied to wetland regulatory status in the U.S.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical alpine grasslands of the northern Andes, commonly known as the
   ,Aram, provide abundant highquality water for downstream populations as
   well as a variety of other environmental services. Yet, very little is
   known about the role that landscape characteristics play in the
   hydrologic functioning of these ecosystems. To help fill this knowledge
   gap, we investigated the relationships between various landscape
   attributes and hydrology in a wet paramo ecosystem of southern Ecuador.
   Using linear regression analysis, we examined the influence of soil
   type, vegetation cover, catchment area, geology, and topography on
   runoff coefficient, streamflow rates, and evapotranspiration. Our study
   site is located at the Zhurucay River experimental catchment, which is
   composed of seven nested microcatchments ranging in size from 0.20 to
   7.53 km(2) and in elevation from 3200 to 3900 m We found that (1) water
   yield accounts for a high percentage of the water budget; (2) runoff
   coefficient and specific discharge are strongly correlated with the
   extent of Andean paramo wetlands (Histosol soils and cushion plants),
   and also increase with catchment size; (3) conversely, inferred
   evapotranspiration is the highest in catchments having the greatest
   percentages of upland terrain (Andosol soils and tussock grasses); and
   (4)low flows are highly positively correlated with steep slopes. These
   results suggest that in the high-elevation tropical grasslands of the
   Andes, runoff coefficient and specific discharge increase with catchment
   size because as catchment size increases, so does the relative area of
   permanently near-saturation zones (Andean paramo wetlands); likely
   because of reduced available storage capacity of the Andean `Aram

Abstract = {{Concern for the health of the Chesapeake Bay and the establishment of
   the Bay Total Maximum Daily Load have led to growing interest in
   restoring and creating wetlands to mitigate agricultural nitrogen
   inputs. All Bay states have included wetland restoration in their
   watershed implementation plans (WIPs) to help meet their required
   reduction in nitrogen loading. In agricultural areas of the coastal
   plain, efforts to develop a watershed-scale approach to siting and
   designing wetlands have been met with considerable challenges. Nitrate
   loss is primarily attributed to base-flow conditions, and groundwater
   flow is multidimensional and highly variable, so accounting for nitrate
   transport connectivity between agricultural N source areas and potential
   wetland restoration areas is difficult. Socioeconomic and political
   challenges also constrain implementation. Our ability to account for
   subsurface connectivity may be improved with better assessment of
   hydrologic connectivity in areas with artificial drainage,
   catchment-scale studies of hydrogeomorphic predictions of hydrologic
   connectivity, and improved use of geospatial data. A coordinated
   monitoring program would improve our ability to estimate wetland
   nitrogen removal efficiencies across environmental and management
   conditions. The addition of a requirement that water quality should be
   an explicit objective of restorations included within WIP accounting
   would avoid the inclusion of projects with minimal water quality
   benefits. Research is also needed on farmer attitudes in the Chesapeake
   Bay watershed toward wetlands for water quality protection. These
   proposed actions would improve our ability to understand and implement

Abstract = {{As Arctic regions warm and frozen soils thaw, the large organic carbon
   pool stored in permafrost becomes increasingly vulnerable to
   decomposition or transport. The transfer of newly mobilized carbon to
   the atmosphere and its potential influence upon climate change will
   largely depend on the degradability of carbon delivered to aquatic
   ecosystems. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a key regulator of aquatic
   metabolism, yet knowledge of the mechanistic controls on DOC
   biodegradability is currently poor due to a scarcity of long-term data
   sets, limited spatial coverage of available data, and methodological
   diversity. Here, we performed parallel biodegradable DOC (BDOC)
   experiments at six Arctic sites (16 experiments) using a standardized
   incubation protocol to examine the effect of methodological differences
   commonly used in the literature. We also synthesized results from 14
   aquatic and soil leachate BDOC studies from across the circum-arctic
   permafrost region to examine panarctic trends in BDOC.
   An increasing extent of permafrost across the landscape resulted in
   higher DOC losses in both soil and aquatic systems. We hypothesize that
   the unique composition of (yedoma) permafrost-derived DOC combined with
   limited prior microbial processing due to low soil temperature and
   relatively short flow path lengths and transport times, contributed to a
   higher overall terrestrial and freshwater DOC loss. Additionally, we
   found that the fraction of BDOC decreased moving down the fluvial
   network in continuous permafrost regions, i.e. from streams to large
   rivers, suggesting that highly biodegradable DOC is lost in headwater
   streams. We also observed a seasonal (January-December) decrease in BDOC
   in large streams and rivers, but saw no apparent change in smaller
   streams or soil leachates. We attribute this seasonal change to a
   combination of factors including shifts in carbon source, changing DOC
   residence time related to increasing thaw-depth, increasing water
   temperatures later in the summer, as well as decreasing hydrologic
   connectivity between soils and surface water as the thaw season
   progresses. Our results suggest that future climate warming-induced
   shifts of continuous permafrost into discontinuous permafrost regions
   could affect the degradation potential of thaw-released DOC, the amount
   of BDOC, as well as its variability throughout the Arctic summer. We
   lastly recommend a standardized BDOC protocol to facilitate the
   comparison of future work and improve our knowledge of processing and
   transport of DOC in a changing Arctic.}},

Abstract = {{Solute concentrations in stream water vary with discharge in patterns
   that record complex feedbacks between hydrologic and biogeochemical
   processes. In a comparison of three shale-underlain headwater catchments
   located in Pennsylvania, USA (the forested Shale Hills Critical Zone
   Observatory), and Wales, UK (the peatland-dominated Upper Hafren and
   forest-dominated Upper Hore catchments in the Plynlimon forest),
   dissimilar concentration-discharge (C-Q) behaviors are best explained by
   contrasting landscape distributions of soil solution chemistry -
   especially dissolved organic carbon (DOC) - that have been established
   by patterns of vegetation and soil organic matter (SOM). Specifically,
   elements that are concentrated in organic-rich soils due to biotic
   cycling (Mn, Ca, K) or that form strong complexes with DOC (Fe, Al) are
   spatially heterogeneous in pore waters because organic matter is
   heterogeneously distributed across the catchments. These solutes exhibit
   non-chemostatic behavior in the streams, and solute concentrations
   either decrease (Shale Hills) or increase (Plynlimon) with increasing
   discharge. In contrast, solutes that are concentrated in soil minerals
   and form only weak complexes with DOC (Na, Mg, Si) are spatially
   homogeneous in pore waters across each catchment. These solutes are
   chemostatic in that their stream concentrations vary little with stream
   discharge, likely because these solutes are released quickly from
   exchange sites in the soils during rainfall events. Furthermore,
   concentration-discharge relationships of non-chemostatic solutes changed
   following tree harvest in the Upper Hore catchment in Plynlimon, while
   no changes were observed for chemostatic solutes, underscoring the role
   of vegetation in regulating the concentrations of certain elements in
   the stream. These results indicate that differences in the hydrologic
   connectivity of organic-rich soils to the stream drive differences in
   concentration behavior between catchments. As such, in catchments where
   SOM is dominantly in lowlands (e.g., Shale Hills), we infer that
   non-chemostatic elements associated with organic matter are released to
   the stream early during rainfall events, whereas in catchments where SOM
   is dominantly in uplands (e.g., Plynlimon), these non-chemostatic
   elements are released later during rainfall events. The distribution of
   SOM across the landscape is thus a key component for predictive models
   of solute transport in headwater catchments.}},

   geomorphic units (levee, backswamp, and toe slope). CO2 emissions
   decreased downstream in backswamps and toe slopes and were high on the
   levees. CH4 and N2O fluxes were near zero; however, CH4 emissions were
   highest in the backswamp. Annual CO2 emissions correlated negatively
   with soil water-filled pore space and positively with variables related
   to drier, coarser soil. Conversely, annual CH4 emissions had the
   opposite pattern of CO2. Spatial variation in aerobic and anaerobic
   respiration was thus controlled by oxygen availability but was not
   related to C inputs from sedimentation or vegetation. The annual mean
   soil CO2 emission rate was 1091gCm(-2)yr(-1), the net sedimentation rate
   was 111gCm(-2)yr(-1), and the vegetation production rate was
   240gCm(-2)yr(-1), with a soil C balance (loss) of -338gCm(-2)yr(-1).
   This floodplain is losing C likely due to long-term drying from
   watershed urbanization.}},

Abstract = {{In this commentary we suggest that hydrologists and land-surface
   modelers may be unnecessarily constraining the behavioral agility of
   very complex physics-based models. We argue that the relatively poor
   performance of such models can occur due to restrictions on their
   ability to refine their portrayal of physical processes, in part because
   of strong a priori constraints in: (i) the representation of spatial
   variability and hydrologic connectivity, (ii) the choice of model
   parameterizations, and (iii) the choice of model parameter values. We
   provide a specific example of problems associated with strong a priori
   constraints on parameters in a land surface model. Moving forward, we
   assert that improving hydrological models requires integrating the
   strengths of the physics-based modeling philosophy (which relies on
   prior knowledge of hydrologic processes) with the strengths of the
   conceptual modeling philosophy (which relies on data driven inference).
   Such integration will accelerate progress on methods to define and
   discriminate among competing modeling options, which should be ideally
   incorporated in agile modeling frameworks and tested through a
   diagnostic evaluation approach.}},

Abstract = {{The risk of pluvial flooding, heat stress and drought is increasing due
   to climate change. To increase urban resilience to extreme weather
   events, it is essential to combine green and blue infrastructure and
   link enhanced storage capacity in periods of water surplus with moments
   of water shortage as well as water availability with heat stress.
   `Blue-green measures' is a collective term for sustainable green and
   blue infrastructure that utilises underlying ecosystem functions to
   deliver multiple benefits: for example, cooling via evapotranspiration,
   water storage for heavy rainfall events, discharge peak attenuation,
   seasonal water storage, and groundwater recharge. Measures contribute
   most to climate adaptation when implemented in combinations. Such
   packages of blue-green measures capitalize upon the synergistic
   interactions between ecosystem functions and hence enhance multiple
   vulnerability reduction capacities. Moreover, combining blue-green
   measures enables using their unique potential at different spatial
   scales and establishing hydrologic connectivity. This paper proposes a
   framework for a planning support system and a tool to select adaptation
   measures to support urban planners in collaboratively finding
   site-specific sets of blue-green measures for a particular urban
   reconstruction project. With the proposed framework users can evaluate
   appropriateness of specific adaptation measures for a particular
   location and compose effective packages of blue-green measures to handle
   flooding, drought and heat stress. It is concluded that the framework:
   1) enables incorporating knowledge on urban climate adaptation and
   ecosystem services in a communicative urban planning process, 2) guides
   the selection of a coherent and effective package of blue-green
   adaptation measures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study rests on three premises: (i) humans are altering
   ecosystems worldwide, (ii) environmental variation often influences the
   strength and nature of sexual selection, and (iii) sexual selection is
   largely responsible for rapid and divergent evolution of male genitalia.
   While each of these assertions has strong empirical support, no study
   has yet investigated their logical conclusion that human impacts on the
   environment might commonly drive rapid diversification of male genital
   morphology. We tested whether anthropogenic habitat fragmentation has
   resulted in rapid changes in the size, allometry, shape, and meristics
   of male genitalia in three native species of livebearing fishes (genus:
   Gambusia) inhabiting tidal creeks across six Bahamian islands. We found
   that genital shape and allometry consistently and repeatedly diverged in
   fragmented systems across all species and islands. Using a model
   selection framework, we identified three ecological consequences of
   fragmentation that apparently underlie observed morphological patterns:
   decreased predatory fish density, increased conspecific density, and
   reduced salinity. Our results demonstrate that human modifications to
   the environment can drive rapid and predictable divergence in male
   genitalia. Given the ubiquity of anthropogenic impacts on the
   environment, future research should evaluate the generality of our
   findings and potential consequences for reproductive isolation.}},

Abstract = {{Although wetlands are known to be sinks for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus
   (P), their function in urban watersheds remains unclear. We analyzed
   water and nitrate (NO3-) and phosphate (PO43-) dynamics during
   precipitation events in two oxbow wetlands that were created during
   geomorphic stream restoration in Baltimore County, Maryland that varied
   in the nature and extent of connectivity to the adjacent stream. Oxbow 1
   (Ox1) received 1.6-4.2\% and Oxbow 2 (Ox2) received 4.2-7.4\% of
   cumulative streamflow during storm events from subsurface seepage (Ox1)
   and surface flow (Ox2). The retention time of incoming stormwater ranged
   from 0.2 to 6.7days in Ox1 and 1.8 to 4.3days in Ox2. Retention rates in
   the wetlands ranged from 0.25 to 2.74gN/m(2)/day in Ox1 and 0.29 to
   1.94gN/m(2)/day in Ox2. Percent retention of the NO3--N load that
   entered the wetlands during the storm events ranged from 64 to 87\% and
   23 to 26\%, in Ox1 and Ox2, respectively. During all four storm events,
   Ox1 and Ox2 were a small net source of dissolved PO43- to the adjacent
   stream (i.e., more P exited than entered the wetland), releasing P at a
   rate of 0.23-20.83mgP/m(2)/day and 3.43-24.84mgP/m(2)/day, respectively.
   N and P removal efficiency of the oxbows were regulated by hydrologic
   connectivity, hydraulic loading, and retention time. Incidental oxbow
   wetlands have potential to receive urban stream and storm flow and to be
   significant N sinks, but they may be sources of P in urban watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrological responses in mountainous headwater catchments are often
   highly non-linear with a distinct threshold-related behavior, which is
   associated to steep hillslopes, shallow soils and strong climatic
   variability. A holistic understanding of the dominant physical processes
   that control streamflow generation and non-linearity is required in
   order to assess potential negative effects of agricultural land use and
   water management in those areas. Therefore, streamflow generation in a
   small pre-Alpine headwater catchment (Upper Rietholzbach (URHB), similar
   to 1 km(2)) was analyzed over a 2-year period by means of
   rainfall-response analysis and water quality data under explicit
   consideration of the joint behaviors of climate forcing and shallow
   groundwater dynamics. The runoff coefficients indicate that only a small
   fraction of the total catchment area (1-26\%) generates streamflow
   during rainfall events. Hereby, the valley bottom areas (riparian zones)
   were the most important event-water source whereas only the lower parts
   of the hillslopes became hydrologically connected to the river network
   with higher antecedent moisture conditions. However, a distinct
   threshold-like behavior could not be observed, suggesting a more
   continuous shift from a riparian-zone to a more hillslope-dominated
   streamflow hydrograph. Regular manure application on the hillslopes in
   combinations with lateral hillslope groundwater flux and long
   groundwater residence times in the riparian zones resulted in a higher
   mineralization (e.g., total phosphorous) and significant denitrification
   in the valley bottom area Despite the important role of the riparian
   zones for event-flow generation in the URHB, their nutrient buffer
   capacity is expected to be small due to the low permeability of the
   local subsurface material. The findings of this integrated analysis are
   summarized in a conceptual framework describing the hydrological
   functioning of hillslopes and riparian zones in the URHB. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Restoring urban infrastructure and managing the nitrogen cycle represent
   emerging challenges for urban water quality. We investigated whether
   stormwater control measures (SCMs), a form of green infrastructure,
   integrated into restored and degraded urban stream networks can
   influence watershed nitrogen loads. We hypothesized that hydrologically
   connected floodplains and SCMs are ``hot spots{''} for nitrogen removal
   through denitrification because they have ample organic carbon, low
   dissolved oxygen levels, and extended hydrologic residence times. We
   tested this hypothesis by comparing nitrogen retention metrics in two
   urban stream networks (one restored and one urban degraded) that each
   contain SCMs, and a forested reference watershed at the Baltimore
   Long-Term Ecological Research site. We used an urban watershed continuum
   approach which included sampling over both space and time with a
   combination of: (1) longitudinal reach-scale mass balances of nitrogen
   and carbon conducted over 2 years during baseflow and storms (n = 24
   sampling dates x 15 stream reaches = 360) and (2) N-15 push-pull tracer
   experiments to measure in situ denitrification in SCMs and floodplain
   features (n = 72). The SCMs consisted of inline wetlands installed below
   a storm drain outfall at one urban site (restored Spring Branch) and a
   wetland/wet pond configured in an oxbow design to receive water during
   high flow events at another highly urbanized site (Gwynns Run). The SCMs
   significantly decreased total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) concentrations at
   both sites and significantly increased dissolved organic carbon
   concentrations at one site. At Spring Branch, TDN retention estimated by
   mass balance (g/day) was similar to 150 times higher within the stream
   network than the SCMs. There were no significant differences between
   mean in situ denitrification rates between SCMs and hydrologically
   connected floodplains. Longitudinal N budgets along the stream network
   showed that hydrologically connected floodplains were important sites
   for watershed nitrogen retention due to groundwater-surface water
   interactions. Overall, our results indicate that hydrologic variability
   can influence nitrogen source/sink dynamics along engineered stream
   networks. Our analysis also suggests that some major predictors for
   watershed N retention were: (1) streamwater and groundwater flux through
   stream restoration or stormwater management controls, (2) hydrologic
   residence times, and (3) surface area of hydrologically connected
   features.}},

Abstract = {{In the alluvial valley of the lower Mississippi River, floodplain lakes
   form isolated aquatic fragments that retain differing degrees of
   connectivity to neighbouring rivers. Within these floodplain lakes it
   was hypothesized that fish species composition, relative abundance, and
   biodiversity metrics would be shaped largely by aquatic connectivity
   within a catchment.Fish assemblages in 13 floodplain lakes (five
   on-channel; eight off-channel) were assessed with electrofishing in
   2006-2012 in the Bear Creek catchment, Mississippi, USA. Bear Creek
   spans approximately 80 km before draining into the Yazoo River, a
   tributary of the Mississippi River.Fish assemblages in on-channel and
   off-channel lakes were different, and fish assemblages in on-channel
   lakes were as a group more homogeneous than off-channel lakes. Moreover,
   a longitudinal gradient in fish assemblages occurred in on-channel
   lakes. The observed patterns in fish assemblages are linked largely to
   differing intensities in connectivity among lakes within the catchment.
   Lakes with irregular connections have greater individuality, whereas
   lakes with continuous or chronic connection are more similar. The wide
   variation in connectivity could be a key to the distinctive biodiversity
   of catchments and the focus of fish conservation programmes.Off-channel
   floodplain lakes are among the first landscape elements to vanish as a
   consequence of agricultural development. These habitats tend to
   accumulate sediments at fast rates and are converted to agricultural
   land as soon as suitable drainage can be attained. Considering that
   off-channel lakes with limited connectivity contribute greatly to the
   heterogeneity of fish assemblages, such losses pose great concerns to
   conservation of biodiversity. Published 2014. This article is a U.S.

   Strong hydrologic connectivity was observed between surface-water and

   fundamental to ensuring species persistence, ecosystem integrity, and
   human well-being. More frequent and severe droughts associated with
   climate change are poised to significantly alter flow intermittence
   patterns and hydrologic connectivity in dryland streams of the American
   Southwest, with deleterious effects on highly endangered fishes. By
   integrating local-scale hydrologic modeling with emerging approaches in
   landscape ecology, we quantify fine-resolution, watershed-scale changes
   in habitat size, spacing, and connectance under forecasted climate
   change in the Verde River Basin, United States. Model simulations
   project annual zero-flow day frequency to increase by 27\% by
   midcentury, with differential seasonal consequences on continuity
   (temporal continuity at discrete locations) and connectivity (spatial
   continuity within the network). A 17\% increase in the frequency of
   stream drying events is expected throughout the network with associated
   increases in the duration of these events. Flowing portions of the river
   network will diminish between 8\% and 20\% in spring and early summer
   and become increasingly isolated by more frequent and longer stretches
   of dry channel fragments, thus limiting the opportunity for native
   fishes to access spawning habitats and seasonally available refuges.
   Model predictions suggest that midcentury and late century climate will
   reduce network-wide hydrologic connectivity for native fishes by 6-9\%
   over the course of a year and up to 12-18\% during spring spawning
   months. Our work quantifies climate-induced shifts in stream drying and
   connectivity across a large river network and demonstrates their
   implications for the persistence of a globally endemic fish fauna.}},

Abstract = {{Inundation hydrology and associated processes control biogeochemical
   processing in floodplains. To better understand how hydrologic
   connectivity, residence time, and intrafloodplain mixing vary in
   floodplain wetlands, we examined how water quality of two contrasting
   areas in the floodplain of the Atchafalaya Rivera flow-through and a
   backwater wetlandresponded to an annual flood pulse. Large, synoptic
   sampling campaigns occurred in both wetlands during the rising limb,
   peak, and falling limb of the hydrograph. Using a combination of
   conservative and reactive tracers, we inferred three dominant processes
   that occurred over the course of the flood pulse: flushing (rising
   limb), advective transport (peak), and organic matter accumulation
   (falling limb). Biogeochemistry of the two wetlands was similar during
   the peak while the river overflowed into both. However, during the
   rising and falling limbs, flow in the backwater wetland experienced much
   greater residence time. This led to the accumulation of dissolved
   organic matter and dissolved phosphorus. There were also elevated ratios
   of dissolved organic carbon to nitrate in the backwater wetland,
   suggesting nitrogen removal was limited by nitrate transported into the
   floodplain there. Collectively, our results suggest inclusion of a
   temporal component into the perirheic concept more fully describes
   inundation hydrology and biogeochemistry in large river floodplain.}},

Abstract = {{Foraging habitat conditions (i.e., water depth, prey biomass, digestible
   energy density) can be a significant predictor of foraging habitat
   selection by wading birds. Potential foraging habitats of Whooping
   Cranes (Grus americana) using marshes include ponds and emergent marsh,
   but the potential prey and energy availability in these habitat types
   have rarely been studied. In this study, we estimated daily digestible
   energy density for Whooping Cranes in different marsh and microhabitat
   types (i.e., pond, flooded emergent marsh). Also, indicator metrics of
   foraging habitat suitability for Whooping Cranes were developed based on
   seasonal water depth, prey biomass, and digestible energy density.
   Seasonal water depth (cm), prey biomass (g wet weight m(-2)), and
   digestible energy density (kcal g(-1)m-(2)) ranged from 0.0 to 50.2 +/-
   2.8, 0.0 to 44.8 +/- 22.3, and 0.0 to 31.0 +/- 15.3, respectively. With
   the exception of freshwater emergent marsh in summer, all available
   habitats were capable of supporting one Whooping Crane per 0.1 ha per
   day. All habitat types in the marshes had relatively higher suitability
   in spring and summer than in fall and winter. Our study indicates that
   based on general energy availability, freshwater marshes in the region
   can support Whooping Cranes in a relatively small area, particularly in
   spring and summer. In actuality, the spatial density of ponds, the flood
   depth of the emergent marsh, and the habitat conditions (e.g.,
   vegetation density) between adjacent suitable habitats will constrain
   suitable habitat and Whooping Crane numbers.}},

Abstract = {{The alluvial floodplains of large rivers are exceptionally productive
   and dynamic ecosystems, characterized by a complex mosaic of vegetation
   at different successional stages overlying soils sorted by historic
   floods. Natural floodplains are widely credited with efficiently
   removing nitrogen from surface waters and accumulating carbon in
   biomass, yet very little floodplain research has examined carbon and
   nitrogen cycling below surficial soils. We evaluated the extent to which
   vegetation cover could be used to predict subsurface carbon and nitrogen
   dynamics and to estimate whole-floodplain carbon storage and
   denitrification rates. We dug soil pits under three dominant vegetation
   communities on a gravel-bedded floodplain in northwest Montana to the
   depth of the permanent water table (1-3m). We compared depth profiles of
   total and dissolved carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), denitrification
   potentials (DEAs), organic particulates, moisture, and pH across
   vegetation types. Near-surface soils (0-10cm) of forests had larger C
   and N pools and DEAs than grasslands or gravel bars, but such vegetation
   effects dissipated within the upper similar to 50cm of soil. At depth,
   spatial heterogeneity in carbon and nitrogen pools and fluxes depended
   instead on soil texture, and relatively high rates of DEA and carbon
   storage were measured in zones of buried organic debris. Although C
   storage and denitrification potential are generally low in subsurface
   soils, these deep soils might nonetheless contribute substantially to
   whole-floodplain C storage and denitrification because of their large
   volume, high hydrologic connectivity, and heterogeneous biogeochemistry.}},

Abstract = {{One consequence of human-driven habitat degradation in general, and
   habitat fragmentation in particular, is loss of biodiversity. An
   often-underappreciated aspect of habitat fragmentation relates to
   changes in the ecology of species that persist in altered habitats. In
   Bahamian wetlands, ecosystem fragmentation causes disruption of
   hydrological connectivity between inland fragmented wetlands and
   adjacent marine areas, with the consequent loss of marine piscivores
   from fragmented sections. We took advantage of this environmental
   gradient to investigate effects of ecosystem fragmentation on patterns
   of resource use in the livebearing fish Gambusia hubbsi (Family
   Poeciliidae), using both population- and individual-level perspectives.
   We show that fragmentation-induced release from predation led to
   increased G. hubbsi population densities, which consequently led to
   lower mean growth rates, likely as a result of higher intraspecific
   competition for food. This was accompanied by a broadening of dietary
   niches via increased interindividual diet variation, suggesting a
   negative effect of predation and a positive effect of intraspecific
   competition on the degree of diet variation in natural populations. Our
   results therefore indicate that habitat fragmentation can greatly impact
   the ecology of resilient populations, with potentially important
   ecological and evolutionary implications.}},

Volume = {{23}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation is a key anthropogenic factor in biodiversity
   decline, particularly in aquatic ecosystems. We predicted that
   differences in fish assemblage composition due to the impact of
   fragmentation would most strongly affect migratory species, and these
   effects would be dependent on the interaction between the
   characteristics of each barrier and the antecedent flow conditions that
   determine temporal variation in connectivity. These hypotheses were
   applied to a coastal river network in eastern Australia that is
   fragmented by multiple weirs and dams, including some with passage
   facilities. How these facilities interact with flow to mediate
   hydrological connectivity and hence patterns of community structure is
   unknown. Five distinct assemblages were identified that were associated
   with different combinations of environmental factors and barrier
   characteristics (spatial arrangement, passability), and key differences
   were due to variation in migration traits. Two spatially distinct
   assemblages were associated with fragmentation by two impassable
   barriers. However, the migration traits that accompanied these community
   changes were inconsistent between these groups, and likely reflected
   effects of barriers near the estuary and in the middle of the stream
   network on diadromous and freshwater-migratory species, respectively.
   Two assemblage groups in the vicinity of passable weirs varied
   temporally as a function of hydrology and the seasonal upstream movement
   of juvenile diadromous species. The effect of habitat loss in
   conjunction with fragmentation was evident, with a further assemblage
   group occurring in reaches where riparian vegetation and instream
   habitat have been altered by poor management of agriculture. This study
   indicates that the impact of habitat fragmentation in rivers depends on
   the interaction of the migration characteristics of biota, temporal
   variation in hydrology which mediates connectivity, and the location of
   anthropogenic barriers. Conservation policies aimed at minimizing human
   impacts on aquatic biodiversity need to jointly account for the separate
   impacts of habitat fragmentation and habitat loss.}},

Abstract = {{Flows from river basins in northwestern Canada have been rising in the
   last two decades as a result of climate warming. In the
   wetland-dominated basins that characterise the southern margin of
   permafrost, permafrost thaw and disappearance, and resulting land-cover
   change, is occurring at an unprecedented rate. The impact of this thaw
   on runoff generation in headwater basins is poorly understood.
   Permafrost thaw has the potential to fundamentally alter the cycling and
   storage of moisture inputs in this region by altering the type and
   relative proportions of the major land-cover types, such as peat
   plateaus, channel fens and flat bogs. This paper examines streamflow
   changes in the four Water Survey of Canada gauged river basins (152-2050
   km(2)) in the lower Liard River valley, Northwest Territories, Canada, a
   region where permafrost thaw has produced widespread loss of forest and
   concomitant expansion of permafrost-free wetlands. Annual runoff in the
   lower Liard Valley increased by between 112 and 160 mm over the period
   of 1996-2012. The Mann-Kendall non-parametric statistical test and the
   Kendall-Theil robust line were used to ascertain changes in streamflow.
   Historical aerial photographs from 1977 and high-resolution satellite
   imagery (WorldView 2) from 2010 were used to measure the rate and
   pattern of permafrost thaw in a representative 6 km(2) area of Scotty
   Creek. Permafrost thaw-induced land-cover change is both increasing the
   adjacency between runoff producing and transmitting land cover types and
   transforming certain land covers that store water into ones that produce
   runoff. This land-cover change was found to be the single most important
   factor (37-61 mm) contributing to the observed increase in river
   discharge. Other contributing factors include increases in plateau
   runoff contributing areas (20-32 mm), increases in annual effective
   precipitation depth (18-30 mm), contribution of water from the melt of
   ice within permafrost (9 mm) and increases in baseflow (0.9-6.8 mm).
   Although runoff has significantly (p < 0.05) increased in all four
   basins, the largest increases are in basins with a relatively high cover
   of flat bogs. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluating nitrate-N fluxes from agricultural landscapes is inherently
   complex due to the wide range of intrinsic and dynamic controlling
   variables. In this study, we investigate the influence of contrasting
   antecedent moisture conditions on nitrate-N flux magnitude and dynamics
   in a single agricultural watershed on intra-annual and rainfall-event
   temporal scales. High temporal resolution discharge and nitrate
   concentration data were collected to evaluate nitrate-N flux magnitude
   associated with wet (2009) and dry (2012) conditions. Analysis of
   individual rainfall events revealed a marked and consistent difference
   in nitrate-N flux response attributed to wet/dry cycles. Large-magnitude
   dilutions (up to 10 mg N L-1) persisted during the wet antecedent
   conditions (2009), consistent with a dominant baseflow contribution and
   excess groundwater release in relation to precipitation volume
   (discharge > > precipitation). Smaller-magnitude concentrations (<7 mg N
   L-1) were observed during the drought conditions of 2012, consistent
   with a quickflow-dominated response to rain events and
   infiltration/storage of precipitation resulting in discharge <
   precipitation. Nitrate-N loads and yields from the watershed were much
   higher (up to an order of magnitude) in the wet year vs. the dry year.
   Our results suggest that the response of nitrate-N loading to rain
   events is highly dependent on intra-annual antecedent moisture
   conditions and subsurface hydrologic connectivity, which together
   dictate the dominant hydrologic pathways for stream recharge.
   Additionally, the results of our study indicate that continued
   pronounced wet/dry cycles may become more dominant as the short-term
   driver of future nitrate-N exports.}},

Abstract = {{Management of wetland connectivity is important for biodiversity
   conservation. In the modern agricultural landscape, the natural
   connections between floodplain wetlands have been greatly altered.
   Agricultural ditches and channelized streams are widely distributed in
   floodplains, which may contribute to the maintenance of wetland
   connectivity and biodiversity. To determine how these watercourse
   networks affect wetland biodiversity, we examined the relationship
   between the species richness of aquatic animals and wetland
   connectivity, with a special focus on species mobility. From July to
   August 2011, fish and aquatic insects were collected from 24 wetlands in
   northern Japan. To determine the degree of wetland connectivity, we
   assessed the relative importance of individual wetlands in maintaining
   the entire wetland network using two connectivity indices: hydrologic
   connectivity via watercourses and spatial connectivity defined as
   Euclidian distances between wetlands using graph theory. We found that
   only high mobility groups of both taxa could enhance species richness in
   either a hydrologic (fish) or spatial (insect) wetland network. The
   species richness of insects with high-flying ability was found to
   increase as spatial connectivity increased. Furthermore, the species
   richness of fish with high-swimming ability was positively influenced by
   hydrologic connectivity, most likely because highly mobile species were
   able to reach suitable habitats and migrate from source populations in a
   wetland network owing to their good mobility. Our findings indicate that
   hydrologic network is important for maintaining biodiversity as well as
   spatial connectivity. It is important to focus conservation efforts on

Abstract = {{Construction of small reservoirs affects ecosystem processes in numerous
   ways including fragmenting stream habitat, altering hydrology, and
   modifying water chemistry. While the upper and middle Chattahoochee
   River basins within the Southeastern United States Piedmont contain few
   natural lakes, they have a high density of small reservoirs (more than
   7500 small reservoirs in the nearly 12,000 km(2) basin). Policymakers
   and water managers in the region have little information about small
   reservoir distribution, uses, or the cumulative inundation of land cover
   caused by small reservoir construction. Examination of aerial
   photography reveals the spatiotemporal patterns and extent of small
   reservoir construction from 1950 to 2010. Over that 60 year timeframe,
   the area inundated by water increased nearly six fold (from 19
   reservoirs covering 0.16\% of the study area in 1950 to 329 reservoirs
   covering 0.95\% of the study area in 2010). While agricultural practices
   were associated with reservoir creation from 1950 to 1970, the highest
   rates of reservoir construction occurred during subsequent suburban

Abstract = {{By coupling synoptic data from a basin-wide assessment of streamwater
   chemistry with network-based geostatistical analysis, we show that
   spatial processes differentially affect biogeochemical condition and
   pattern across a headwater stream network. We analyzed a high-resolution
   dataset consisting of 664 water samples collected every 100 m throughout
   32 tributaries in an entire fifth-order stream network. These samples
   were analyzed for an exhaustive suite of chemical constituents. The fine
   grain and broad extent of this study design allowed us to quantify
   spatial patterns over a range of scales by using empirical
   semivariograms that explicitly incorporated network topology. Here, we
   show that spatial structure, as determined by the characteristic shape
   of the semivariograms, differed both among chemical constituents and by
   spatial relationship (flow-connected, flow-unconnected, or Euclidean).
   Spatial structure was apparent at either a single scale or at multiple
   nested scales, suggesting separate processes operating simultaneously
   within the stream network and surrounding terrestrial landscape.
   Expected patterns of spatial dependence for flow-connected relationships
   (e.g., increasing homogeneity with downstream distance) occurred for
   some chemical constituents (e.g., dissolved organic carbon, sulfate, and
   aluminum) but not for others (e.g., nitrate, sodium). By comparing
   semivariograms for the different chemical constituents and spatial
   relationships, we were able to separate effects on streamwater chemistry
   of (i) fine-scale versus broad-scale processes and (ii) in-stream
   processes versus landscape controls. These findings provide insight on
   the hierarchical scaling of local, longitudinal, and landscape processes
   that drive biogeochemical patterns in stream networks.}},

Abstract = {{Observation of temporal variations in soil moisture along transects is
   important when examining hydrological processes on a hillslope. Although
   there is substantial interest in characterizing catchment hydrology
   through an investigation of hydrologic connectivity, few attempts have
   been made to explore hydrologic connectivity within soil layers using
   soil moisture observations. Mathematical relationships among soil
   moisture differences are reproducible when Granger causality is defined
   within the context of hydrological connectivity because the process
   based transfer functions facilitate soil moisture predictions. Soil
   moisture time series along two transects on a steep hillslope were
   obtained using a multiplexed time domain reflectometry system during the
   growing season in June 2008 and 2009. The transfer function
   relationships between multiple soil moisture differences were delineated
   to determine a representative point for reliable time series modeling,
   and to establish the spatial pattern of areal clusters that will enable
   model identification and prediction. The impact of hillslope topography
   on the modeling of coupled soil moisture was highlighted by configuring
   the threshold behavior of model predictability. Results showed that soil
   moisture temporal relationships can be used for the prediction of
   volumetric soil moisture, within a specific area associated with
   representation point. Reliable relationships among soil moistures were
   apparent for points having greater upslope areas between 400 m(2) and

Abstract = {{We examined the contribution of three types of side channels based on
   their hydrologic connectivity (seasonally disconnected, partially
   connected, and connected) to production of juvenile anadromous
   salmonids. Juvenile steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss and Chinook Salmon O.
   tshawytscha were found in all three of these side channel types and in
   each year of the study. Upon connection with the main stem at high
   flows, the seasonally disconnected side channels experienced an emptying
   out of the previous year's fish while filling with young-of-year fish
   during the 2- to 4-month period of hydrologic connection. There were no
   differences between the densities of juvenile steelhead and Chinook
   Salmon and the rate of smolts produced among the three types of side
   channels. Recently reintroduced Coho Salmon O. kisutch had sporadic
   presence and abundance in partially and connected side channels, but the
   smolt production rate was over two times that of steelhead and Chinook
   Salmon in seasonally disconnected side channels. Within seasonally
   disconnected side channels, young-of-year salmonids in deep pools (>=
   100cm) had greater survival than those in shallow pools (<100cm).
   Densities of juvenile steelhead in all side channel types were similar
   to those in tributaries and were higher than in main-stem lateral
   margins. Juvenile Chinook Salmon densities were higher in side channels
   than in both tributary and main-stem lateral margins. Our results
   suggest that improving quality of pool habitat within seasonally
   disconnected side channels can result in improved survival for juvenile
   anadromous salmonids during the period of disconnection. Habitat
   improvement in these seasonally disconnected side channels should be
   recognized as a worthy restoration strategy, especially when full
   connectivity of side channels may not be a feasible target (e.g.,
   through lack of water availability) or when full connectivity may

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic impacts to island systems can have deleterious effects on
   coastal aquatic ecosystems. These effects can alter water quality,

   hydrologic connectivity within aquatic ecosystems forcing alterations in
   nutrient transport and increases the potential for eutrophication. Dove
   Sound, a tidal lagoon located in the Upper Florida Keys on Key Largo,

   during the last century. To investigate these influences a short
   sediment core was collected from within Dove Sound and investigated
   using Pb-210 dating, stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, and
   sedimentary pigments. Results indicated that Dove Sound has undergone
   eutrophication and the primary producer community structure has shifted
   from dominantly macrophytic to a system that supports substantial algal
   production. While septic waste was a possible source for eutrophication,
   low delta N-15 did not support this conclusion. However, the timing of
   the shifts in Dove Sound along with indicators of anoxia leads to the
   conclusion that fragmentation caused by the construction of a railroad

Abstract = {{This study presents the importance of disconnectivity in dryland area
   runoff demonstrated by manmade water harvesting structures dated to
   Greco-Roman times. Located on the coastal strip of some 20 km width
   along the Mediterranean coast of modern northwestern Egypt covering the
   north-eastern part of the region known in antiquity as Marmarica, the
   area receives winterly rainfalls of up to 140 mm. Further south,
   precipitation decreases quickly and desert conditions become more
   pronounced. Bedrocks are predominantly calcareous, soils are loamy,
   stony, calcareous, and shallow, except in relief sinks with sedimentary
   deposits. The land rises from the coast up to 230 ma.s.l. on the
   Marmarica Plateau in a sequence of zonal northsloping plains and scarps
   the northern parts of which are dissected and drained by wadis.
   Agriculturally suitable areas comprise some 9\% of the coastal zone and
   adjacent tablelands. Overland flow controls the discharge dynamics and
   is the main source of wadi runoff and hence agricultural water supply.
   The land use pattern is scattered because cropping areas depend mainly
   on suitability of soils and the generation of runoff harvest, which are
   closely interrelated because of the arid water and sediment regime. The
   patchiness of runoff generation increases further south where aridity is
   higher and topography inhibits greater drainage patterns. The abundance
   of cisterns, many of them originally Greco-Roman, is strong evidence
   that tableland overland flows occur and are frequently disconnected from
   larger drainage systems. Abandoned ancient rainwater harvesting and
   watershed management systems are abundant all over the region and
   incorporate the hydrological experience of the former inhabitants,
   having been dated with OSL and pottery mainly from Greco-Roman times.
   While the region prospered some two millenia ago, the ancient water
   management schemes are generally abandoned today.
   One of the most outstanding features of the ancient systems was the
   systematic harvesting of tableland and valley slope overland flow above
   the wadi beds. Part of this strategy was to separate the remote parts of
   large natural watersheds from the local parts by shallow stone bunds on
   the tableland. The collected tableland overland flow irrigated terraced
   fields on the tableland (lairum). The remaining water harvesting areas,
   mainly valley slopes, were obviously sufficient to supply water for
   small tributary wadis, large side terraces and the floodplains of large
   wadis. The artificial disconnection of local runoff areas from remote
   parts of the northern watersheds is hydrologically well adapted to the
   runoff dynamics in the flat landscape of the northern Marmarica because
   it protected valleys from low frequency high magnitude runoff events
   which are generated mainly on the remote parts of large catchments but
   which are inefficient in terms of water harvesting. Terracing and water
   harvesting structures are frequently buried in well-sorted, fine-grained
   sediment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the combined effects of vegetation and topography
   on hillslope water table dynamics. In forested headwater catchments,
   complex terrain and vegetation intersect to impose large spatial and
   temporal variability in the vertical and lateral redistribution of water
   from hillslopes to streams. Here, we demonstrate, using empirical data
   from the Northern Rocky Mountains, that vegetation interacts with
   landscape topography to influence hillslope-riparian-stream hydrologic
   connectivity. We compared a measured relationship between hillslope
   contributing area and hydrologic connectivity during the growing season
   to LiDAR-derived vegetation characteristics and found that two
   behavioural regimes emerged. Among some hillslopes, hydrologic
   connectivity decreased as vegetation density increased, demonstrating
   that growing season hydrologic connectivity is subject to the balance
   between evapotranspiration and lateral redistribution of soil water.
   Among other hillslopes, hydrologic connectivity increased as vegetation
   density increased. For the latter set of hillslopes, hydrologic
   connectivity cannot be explained by topography and vegetation alone.
   When we compared joint distributions of vegetation density and modelled
   solar irradiance between the two regimes as another indicator of
   evapotranspiration, we found that conditions were generally more
   favourable for higher transpiration on hillslopes where hydrologic
   connectivity decreased as vegetation density increased than on
   hillslopes where the opposite behaviour was observed. Our results
   demonstrate not only the importance of vegetation heterogeneity for
   hillslope-riparian-stream connectivity but also the importance of other
   spatially distributed variables such as energy availability when
   considering the influence of topography on hydrological processes.

Abstract = {{Topographic depressions, areas of no lateral surface flow, are
   ubiquitous characteristics of the land surface that control many
   ecosystem and biogeochemical processes. High density of depressions
   increases the surface storage capacity, whereas lower depression density
   increases runoff, thus influencing soil moisture states, hydrologic
   connectivity, and the climate-soil-vegetation interactions. With the
   widespread availability of high-resolution lidar-based digital elevation
   model (lDEM) data, it is now possible to identify and characterize the
   structure of the spatial distribution of topographic depressions for
   incorporation in ecohydrologic and biogeochemical studies. Here we use
   lDEM data to document the prevalence and patterns of topographic
   depressions across five different landscapes in the United States and
   quantitatively characterize the probability distribution of attributes,
   such as surface area, storage volume, and the distance to the nearest
   neighbor. Through the use of a depression identification algorithm, we
   show that these probability distributions of attributes follow scaling
   laws indicative of a structure in which a large fraction of land surface
   areas can consist of high number of topographic depressions of all sizes
   and can account for 4 to 21 mm of depression storage. This implies that
   the impacts of small-scale topographic depressions in the landscapes on
   the redistribution of material fluxes, evaporation, and hydrologic
   connectivity are quite significant.

Abstract = {{We analyzed basal sources, trophic levels, and connectance in dry-season
   food webs on 4 rivers in the upper Burdekin catchment in the dry tropics
   of northeastern Australia. The region is characterized by episodic
   summer rainfall, and most of the annual river flow occurs in a short
   period. In the dry season, rivers typically contract into a series of
   water holes of varying permanence and hydrologic connectivity. We used
   stable-isotope and stomach-content analyses to identify trophic levels
   of macroinvertebrates and fish, and we used a mixing model (SIAR) to
   identify foodweb basal sources at each site. We found substantial
   variability among sites in basal-source contributions, trophic position
   of individual taxa, and foodweb structure, and sites from the same river
   often were as different as sites from different rivers. Important basal
   sources at different sites included allochthonous tree litter,
   autochthonous algae and macrophytes, and Fe-fixing bacteria. Many
   relationships between consumers and basal sources were not resolved in
   the mixing model, mainly because of extensive omnivory or isotopic
   overlap among sources. Nevertheless, our results show high variability
   of dry-tropics river communities that extends beyond previously
   described macroinvertebrate assemblages to the broader food web.
   However, the main components of the upper trophic levels were similar
   across sites, such that different lower trophic levels supported similar
   assemblages of top consumers. These tropical rivers were defined by
   omnivory and ecological opportunism, which may be adaptations to
   seasonal hydrological variability.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrologic connectivity between the channel and floodplain is thought to
   be a dominant factor determining floodplain processes and
   characteristics of floodplain forests. We explored the role of
   hydrologic connectivity in explaining floodplain forest community
   composition along streams in northern Missouri, USA. Hydrologic analyses
   at 20 streamgages (207-5827km(2) area) document that magnitudes of
   2-year return floods increase systematically with increasing drainage
   area whereas the average annual number and durations of
   floodplain-connecting events decrease. Flow durations above the
   active-channel shelf vary little with increasing drainage area,
   indicating that the active-channel shelf is in quasi-equilibrium with
   prevailing conditions. The downstream decrease in connectivity is
   associated with downstream increase in channel incision. These relations
   at streamflow gaging stations are consistent with regional channel
   disturbance patterns: channel incision increases downstream, whereas
   upstream reaches have either not incised or adjusted to incision by
   forming new equilibrium floodplains. These results provide a framework
   to explain landscape-scale variations in composition of floodplain
   forest communities in northern Missouri. Faust () had tentatively
   explained increases of flood-dependent tree species, and decreases of
   species diversity, with a downstream increase in flood magnitude and
   duration. Because frequency and duration of floodplain-connecting events
   do not increase downstream, we hypothesize instead that increases in
   relative abundance of flood-dependent trees at larger drainage area
   result from increasing size of disturbance patches. Bank-overtopping
   floods at larger drainage area create large, open, depositional
   landforms that promoted the regeneration of shade-intolerant species.
   Higher tree species diversity in floodplains with small drainage areas
   is associated with non-incised floodplains that are frequently connected
   to their channels and therefore subject to greater effective hydrologic
   variability compared with downstream floodplains. Understanding the
   landscape-scale geomorphic and hydrologic controls on floodplain
   connectivity provides a basis for more effective management and
   restoration of floodplain forest communities. Published 2013. This

Abstract = {{Geographically isolated wetlands (GIW), depressional landscape features
   entirely surrounded by upland areas, provide a wide range of ecological
   functions and ecosystem services for human well-being. Current and
   future ecosystem management and decision-making rely on a solid
   scientific understanding of how hydrologic processes affect these
   important GIW services and functions, and in turn on how GIWs affect
   downstream surface water systems. Consequently, quantifying the
   hydrologic connectivity of GIWs to other surface water systems
   (including streams, rivers, lakes, and other navigable waters) and the
   processes governing hydrologic connectivity of GIWs at a variety of
   watershed scales has become an important topic for the scientific and
   decision-making communities. We review examples of potential mechanistic
   modeling tools that could be applied to further advance scientific
   understanding concerning: (1) The extent to which hydrologic connections
   between GIWs and other surface waters exist, and (2) How these
   connections affect downstream hydrology at the scale of watersheds.
   Different modeling approaches involve a variety of domain and process
   conceptualizations, and numerical approximations for GIW-related
   questions. We describe select models that require only limited
   modifications to model the interaction of GIWs and other surface waters.
   We suggest that coupled surface subsurface approaches exhibit the most
   promise for characterizing GIW connectivity under a variety of flow
   conditions, though we note their complexity and the high level of
   modeling expertise required to produce reasonable results. We also
   highlight empirical techniques that will inform mechanistic models that
   estimate hydrologic connectivity of GIWs for research, policy, and
   management purposes. Developments in the related disciplines of remote
   sensing, hillslope and wetland hydrology, empirical modeling, and tracer
   studies will assist in advancing current mechanistic modeling approaches
   to most accurately elucidate connectivity of GIWs to other surface
   waters and the effects of GIWs on downstream systems at the watershed
   scale. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The roles of both landscape alteration and in-lake processes need to be

   regions of North America. Here we focus on shallow lakes in west-central
   Minnesota, USA, highlighting the long-term ecological history and
   response to known landscape changes of a clear-water,
   macrophyte-dominated, shallow lake. Contemporary limnological data
   suggest the aquatic ecosystem has been very stable and fishless for the
   last similar to 15 years. Sediment proxies for primary production and
   ecological change confirm that a stable ecosystem likely prevailed for
   the last similar to 200 years. However, sedimentary indicators of
   catchment erosion detail a distinct response to land-use change during
   the conversion of native grassland to agricultural land, and following
   establishment of a protected waterfowl production area (WPA) around the
   lake. Post-WPA, the rate of sediment accrual decreased dramatically
   within 5-10 years and sources of organic matter were similar to those of
   the pre-settlement period. The aquatic ecosystem has been able to
   withstand nutrient enrichment and allochthonous inputs because stable
   trophic interactions have likely been in place for more than 200 years.
   We conclude that lack of hydrologic connectivity and isolated, small
   catchments are important factors in the promotion of clear-water shallow
   lake ecosystems, mainly because they prevent colonization by fish and
   associated ecological consequences. This study highlights the importance
   of managing both the landscape and in-lake processes to maintain stable,

Abstract = {{Monitoring runoff generation processes in the field is a prerequisite
   for developing conceptual hydrological models and theories. At the same
   time, our perception of hydrological processes strongly depends on the
   spatial and temporal scale of observation. Therefore, the aim of this
   study is to investigate interactions between runoff generation processes
   of different spatial scales (plot scale, hillslope scale, and headwater
   scale). Different runoff generation processes of three hillslopes with
   similar topography, geology and soil properties, but differences in
   vegetation cover (grassland, coniferous forest, and mixed forest) within
   a small v-shaped headwater were measured: water table dynamics in wells
   with high spatial and temporal resolution, subsurface flow (SSF) of
   three 10m wide trenches at the bottom of the hillslopes subdivided into
   two trench sections each, overland flow at the plot scale, and catchment
   runoff. Bachmair et al. () found a high spatial variability of water
   table dynamics at the plot scale. In this study, we investigate the
   representativity of SSF observations at the plot scale versus the
   hillslope scale and vice versa, and the linkage between hillslope
   dynamics (SSF and overland flow) and streamflow. Distinct differences in
   total SSF within each 10m wide trench confirm the high spatial
   variability of the water table dynamics. The representativity of plot
   scale observations for hillslope scale SSF strongly depends on whether
   or not wells capture spatially variable flowpaths. At the grassland
   hillslope, subsurface flowpaths are not captured by our relatively
   densely spaced wells (3m), despite a similar trench flow response to the
   coniferous forest hillslope. Regarding the linkage between hillslope
   dynamics and catchment runoff, we found an intermediate to high
   correlation between streamflow and hillslope hydrological dynamics
   (trench flow and overland flow), which highlights the importance of
   hillslope processes in this small watershed. Although the total
   contribution of SSF to total event catchment runoff is rather small, the
   contribution during peak flow is moderate to substantial. Additionally,
   there is process synchronicity between spatially discontiguous
   measurement points across scales, potentially indicating subsurface
   flowpath connectivity. Our findings stress the need for (i) a
   combination of observations at different spatial scales, and (ii) a
   consideration of the high spatial variability of SSF at the plot and
   hillslope scale when designing monitoring networks and assessing
   hydrological connectivity. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   ponds near Churchill (Manitoba) three times during the ice-free season
   of 2010 to explore relations among hydrological connectivity, basin
   morphometry, and water-chemistry variations. Using principal components
   analysis, we identified that the ponds followed one of four distinctive
   ``seasonal water chemistry trajectories{''} (SWCT1-4). Most of the ponds
   that lacked apparent hydrologic connectivity displayed SWCT1,
   characterized by rising alkalinity and ionic content between early June
   and late July due to evaporative concentration. In contrast, most ponds
   with apparent hydrological connectivity displayed SWCT2 or SWCT3,
   characterized by marked changes in suspended sediment and total nitrogen
   concentrations due to inflow that transferred allochthonous materials
   from the catchment. Ponds in SWCT2 likely possessed temporary
   hydrological connections during periods of relatively high water supply
   and exhibited marked decline of suspended sediment and total nitrogen
   content when hydrological connection was lost. Most ponds in SWCT3
   maintained active hydrological connections during all or most of the
   ice-free season and possessed relatively high suspended sediment and
   total nitrogen concentrations throughout the season. Ponds in SWCT4
   possessed relatively stable water chemistry due to greater water depth
   and local features that reduced wind-induced sediment resuspension. We

Abstract = {{A large number of wetlands, lakes and ponds exist in northern Canada,
   Alaska and Siberia, and the hydrologic and ecological processes in these
   water bodies are now responding to a changing climate. A large wetland,
   Polar Bear Pass (PBP), situated in the middle of Bathurst Island is
   considered to be one of the most important ecological sites in the
   region. Numerous ponds exist at PBP and are connected to their
   surrounding watersheds by streams and groundwater inflow, receiving
   varying amounts of water and nutrients. In 2008 and 2009, the
   representative hydrology of typical ponds at PBP along with their
   quantity of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC,
   respectively) was evaluated. Pond DOC and DIC loads and composition
   differ depending on the presence or absence of one or more hydrologic
   linkages that a pond has with its catchment. Elevated DOC loads were
   mostly of terrestrial origin and occurred in ponds receiving meltwater
   from snowbeds and discharge from hillslope creeks. The seasonal shift in
   connectivity of a pond to its catchment was critical in controlling DOC
   loads and concentrations. The frequency and duration of summer
   precipitation had a strong control on pond hydrologic connectivity and
   elevated the contribution of terrestrial DOC from wetland to ponds,
   especially ones that were hydrologically connected. The estimated DOC
   yields from wet meadow catchments highlight their importance as a source
   of carbon to pond ecosystems downstream. These wetland areas and ponds

Volume = {{205}},
Number = {{SI}},

Abstract = {{Naturally induced longitudinal disconnectivity in the form of
   channel-spanning logjams creates backwaters along headwater streams that
   reduce velocity and transport capacity, create at least temporary
   storage sites for finer sediment and organic matter, and enhance
   biological processing and uptake of nutrients. Land uses that reduce
   wood recruitment and instream storage result in reduced stream
   complexity and increased longitudinal connectivity in headwater rivers.
   We examine three scales of naturally occurring longitudinal
   disconnectivity in headwater streams of the Colorado Front Range and the
   implications for channel process and form of historical alterations in
   disconnectivity. Basin-scale disconnectivity at channel lengths of
   10(2)-10(3) m results from downstream alternations between steep,
   narrowly confined valley segments with single-thread channels, and lower
   gradient, wider, valley segments with multi-thread channels. This
   variation in valley geometry likely reflects differences in average
   spacing between joints in bedrock outcrops, which influences bedrock
   weathering and erosion. Greater volumes of wood stored in the wide
   valley segments correlate with more closely spaced channel-spanning
   logjams and greater storage of fine sediments and organic matter.
   Reach-scale disconnectivity at channel lengths of 10(1)-10(2) m results
   from the presence of numerous, closely spaced channel-spanning logjams,
   which cumulatively store substantial amounts of fine sediment and
   organic matter. The backwater effects associated with an individual jam
   can result in the accumulation of up to similar to 11 m(3) of fine
   sediment upstream from the jam, of which as much as 21\% is organic
   matter. Unit-scale disconnectivity at channel lengths of 10(0)-10(1) m
   results from the presence of an individual channel-spanning logjam,
   which locally alters bed gradient, substrate composition, bedform
   dimensions, and the transport of sediment and organic matter. The
   transport and storage of instream wood is a critical component of
   disconnectivity at all spatial scales examined. Land uses such as timber
   harvest, flow regulation, and placer mining that result in reduced wood
   recruitment or removal of instream wood appear to create an alternative
   stable state in which channels are unable to retain wood because of
   reduced debris roughness. The net effect of reduced longitudinal
   disconnectivity is increased transport of fine sediment and organic
   matter and reduced biological uptake of nutrients. The altered headwater
   streams become leaky with respect to fine sediments and nutrients. (C)

   two freshwater crab species, Zilchiopsis collastinensis and
   Trichodactylus borellianus, from localities of the middle Parana River
   basin during two phases of the local hydrological regime. Specimens were
   sampled at sites (localities) of Parana River, Saladillo Stream, Salado
   River and Coronda River when water levels were falling and rising. The
   conductivity, pH, temperature and geographical coordinates were recorded
   at each site. The dorsal cephalothorax of each crab was represented
   using 16 landmarks for Z. collastinensis and 14 landmarks for T.
   borellianus. The Canonical Variate Analyses showed differences in shape
   (for both species) among the crabs collected from the Parana and Salado
   Rivers during the two hydrologic phases. We did not find a general
   distribution pattern for shape among the crab localities. During falling
   water, the shapes of Z. collastinensis were not related to
   latitude-longitude gradient (i.e., showing greater overlap in shape),
   while during rising water the shapes were ordered along a distributional
   gradient according to geographical location. Contrary, shapes of T.
   borellianus were related to latitude-longitude during falling water and
   were not related to distributional gradient during rising water. The
   cephalothorax shape showed, in general, no statistically significant
   covariations with environmental variables for either species. These
   results show that each freshwater crab species, from different
   localities of the middle Parana River, remain connected; however, these
   connections change throughout the hydrologic regime of the floodplain

   shapes of crabs of localities varies during two phases of the

Abstract = {{Understanding the diverse ways that landscape connectivity influences
   the distribution of microbial species is central to managing the spread
   and persistence of numerous biological invasions. Here, we use
   geospatial analytics to examine the degree to which the hydrologic
   connectivity of landscapes influences the transport of passively
   dispersed microbes, using the invasive plant pathogen Phytophthora
   ramorum as a case study. Pathogen occurrence was analyzed at 280 stream
   baiting stations across a range of watersheds - exposed to variable
   inoculum pressure - in California over a 7-year period (2004-2010).
   Using logistic regression, we modeled the probability of pathogen
   occurrence at a baiting station based on nine environmental variables.
   We developed a novel geospatial approach to quantify the hydrologic
   connectivity of host vegetation and inoculum pressure derived from least
   cost distance analyses in each watershed. We also examined the influence
   of local environmental conditions within the immediate neighborhood of a
   baiting station. Over the course of the sampling period, the pathogen
   was detected at 67 baiting stations associated with coastal watersheds
   with mild climate conditions, steep slopes, and higher levels of
   inoculum pressure. At the watershed scale, hydrologic landscape
   connectivity was a key predictor of pathogen occurrence in streams after
   accounting for variation in climate and exposure to inoculum. This study

Abstract = {{Fire severity and burn patchiness are frequently cited as important to
   post-fire surface runoff and erosion, yet few studies quantify their
   effects. A better understanding of their role is needed to predict
   post-fire erosion and design prescribed burns. Therefore, this study
   quantified the effects of fire severity and burn patchiness on surface
   runoff, erosion and hydrologic connectivity using 116 unbounded runoff
   samplers. The samplers were installed in recently prescribed burnt dry
   eucalypt forest in Victoria, Australia. Sediment loads over 16-months
   were approximately three orders of magnitude higher on burnt compared
   with unburnt hillslopes while differences in runoff and erosion between
   the low and high severity hillslopes were relatively small. Unburnt
   patches were often highly effective at reducing hydrologic connectivity
   from upslope burnt areas, with sediment loads over 16-months reduced by
   1.3\%, 98.1\% and 99.9\% downslope of 1, 5 and 10 m wide unburnt patches
   respectively. Hydrologic connectivity was limited most effectively by
   wider unburnt patches (10 m) and during lower magnitude storms. The
   results suggest overall that post-fire runoff and erosion may be
   substantially limited by unburnt patches while fire severity is a less
   important factor (within the context of prescribed burning).
   Consequently, post-fire erosion models should consider the spatial
   arrangement of unburnt patches, and unburnt patches (>10 m wide) should
   be retained within prescribed burns to minimise erosion. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{With small reservoirs increasingly employed to meet human water needs,
   tools that consider cumulative effects of multiple small reservoirs
   through space and time are essential for understanding impacts of these
   spatially distributed stresses on catchment hydrology and related
   ecological processes. We used a GIS-based hydrologic model to predict
   streamflow impairment caused by 438 small reservoirs in a 743 km(2)
   study area in Sonoma County, California, USA. The GIS model was designed
   to consider the varying effects that these reservoirs have through the
   project area drainage network, as well as the varying effects they have
   over time (as reservoirs fill and no longer impair flow downstream).
   Results indicate that, at the onset of the water year (when reservoirs
   are assumed to be empty), more than 25 \% of the drainage network below
   reservoirs is impaired by over 50 \%. Nine weeks into a normal-type
   water year, approximately 25 \% of the drainage network below reservoirs
   is impaired by at least 25 \%; and at 15 weeks, five percent of the
   drainage below reservoirs is impaired at least 25 \%. Impairment is more
   persistent in a dry-type year. Nine weeks into a dry year, almost 40 \%
   of the drainage network below reservoirs is impaired by at least 25 \%;
   and at 15 weeks, 25 \% of the drainage is impaired by at least 25 \%.
   Results illustrate that impairment caused by reservoirs varies
   appreciably over space, but as reservoirs fill over time, impairment is
   lower through most of the drainage network.}},

Abstract = {{Although temporal variation in headwater stream chemistry has long been
   used to document baseline conditions and response to environmental
   drivers, less attention is paid to fine scale spatial variations that
   could yield clues to processes controlling stream water sources. We
   documented spatial and temporal variation in water composition in a
   headwater catchment (41ha) at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH,
   USA. We sampled every 50m along an ephemeral to perennial stream network
   as well as groundwater from seeps and 35 shallow wells across varying
   flow conditions. Groundwater influences on surface water in this region
   have not been considered to be important in past studies as relatively
   coarse soils were assumed to be well drained in steep catchments with
   flashy runoff response. However, seeps displayed perennial discharge,
   upslope accumulated areas (UAA) smaller than those for channel
   initiation sites and higher pH, Ca and Si concentrations than streams,
   suggesting relatively long groundwater residence time or long subsurface
   flow paths not bound by topographic divides. Coupled with a large range
   in groundwater chemistry seen in wells, these results suggest stream
   chemistry variation reflects the range of connectivity with, and quality
   of, groundwater controlled by hillslope hydropedological processes. The
   magnitude of variations of solute concentrations seen in the first order
   catchment was as broad as that seen at the fifth order Hubbard Brook
   Valley (3519ha). Reduction in variation in solute concentrations with
   increasing UAA suggested a representative elementary area (REA) value of
   less than 3ha in the first order catchment, compared with 100ha for the
   fifth order basin. Thus, the REA is not necessarily an elementary
   catchment property. Rather, the partitioning of variation between highly
   variable upstream sources and relatively homogenous downstream
   characteristics may have different physical significance depending on
   the scale and complexity of the catchment under examination. Copyright

Abstract = {{Land surfaces are generally not smooth and show certain irregularity.
   Overland flow on such surfaces is essentially discontinuous and exhibits
   strong variability and complexity. Modeling of the spatio-temporal
   variability and heterogeneity of overland flow and the hydrotopographic
   effects has been proven to be a challenge. The objective of this study
   is to quantitatively describe the intrinsic spatio-temporal variations
   in hydrologic connectivity associated with overland flow generation.
   Firstly, a puddle-to-puddle (P2P) hydrologic connectivity concept was
   proposed to characterize runoff generation processes and the related
   spatio-temporal dynamics. Secondly, a laboratory overland flow
   experiment was conducted to characterize the dynamic puddle filling and
   spilling processes, hydrologic connectivity, and outlet discharge.
   Thirdly, a conceptual P2P model was applied to simulate the P2P overland
   flow dynamics, calculate flow discharge, and track the evolution of
   hydrologically connected areas. Particularly, two modified hydrologic
   connectivity indices, time-varying connectivity function and
   connectivity length, were proposed to characterize the properties and
   dynamic changes in hydrologic connectivity. Furthermore, the influences
   of surface topography, rainfall, and surface slope on hydrologic
   connectivity were evaluated. The proposed hydrologic connectivity
   indices effectively revealed the variability and the threshold behavior
   of overland flow generation. It was demonstrated that the dynamic P2P
   processes governed hydrologic connectivity, controlled surface runoff
   generation, and altered the flow drainage patterns. Temporal variations
   of rainfall intensity changed the occurrence timing of the P2P dynamics
   and evolution of connected areas, while spatial variations of rainfall
   intensity directly influenced the overall development of hydrologic
   connectivity of a hydrologic system. Surface slope showed considerable
   influences on hydrologic connectivity. The results suggested that
   critical slope(s) could exist, at which a sharp change in flow drainage
   area and hydrologic connectivity occurred. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{To explore the value of high-frequency monitoring to characterise and
   explain riverine nutrient concentration dynamics, total phosphorus (TP),
   reactive phosphorus (RP), ammonium (NH4-N) and nitrate (NO3-N)
   concentrations were measured hourly over a 2-year period in the Duck
   River, in north-western Tasmania, Australia, draining a 369-km(2) mixed
   land use catchment area. River discharge was observed at the same
   location and frequency, spanning a wide range of hydrological
   conditions. Nutrient concentrations changed rapidly and were higher than
   previously observed. Maximum nutrient concentrations were 2,577 mu g L-1
   TP, 1,572 mu g L-1 RP, 972 mu g L-1 NH4-N and 1,983 mu g L-1 NO3-N,
   respectively. Different nutrient response patterns were evident at
   seasonal, individual event and diurnal time scales-patterns that had
   gone largely undetected in previous less frequent water quality
   sampling. Interpretation of these patterns in terms of nutrient source
   availability, mobilisation and delivery to the stream allowed the
   development of a conceptual model of catchment nutrient dynamics.
   Functional stages of nutrient release were identified for the Duck River
   catchment and were supported by a cluster analysis which confirmed the
   similarities and differences in nutrient responses caused by the
   sequence of hydrologic events: (1) a build-up of nutrients during
   periods with low hydrologic activity, (2) flushing of readily available
   nutrient sources at the onset of the high flow period, followed by (3) a
   switch from transport to supply limitation, (4) the accessibility of new
   nutrient sources with increasing catchment wetness and hydrologic
   connectivity and (5) high nutrient spikes occurring when new sources
   become available that are easily mobilised with quickly re-established
   hydrologic connectivity. Diurnal variations that could be influenced by
   riverine processes and/or localised point sources were also identified
   as part of stage (1) and during late recession of some of the winter
   high flow events. Illustrated by examples from the Duck River study, we
   demonstrate that the use of high-frequency monitoring to identify and
   characterise functional stages of catchment nutrient release is a
   constructive approach for informing and supporting catchment management
   and future nutrient monitoring strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrologic alterations designed to provide a stable water supply and to

   freshwater ecosystems depends on maintaining and recovering hydrologic
   habitat connectivity, which includes structural components related to
   the physical landscape, functionality of flow dynamics, and an

   the effects of restoration on hydrologic habitat connectivity. We then
   illustrate this approach through a case study on lateral hydrologic
   habitat connectivity that results from channel restoration scenarios
   using scenarios with different historic and climate-change flows to
   restore fish floodplain habitat in a med-river, the San Joaquin River,

Abstract = {{We present a new hydrologic model based on the frequency distribution of
   hillslope landscape elements along the stream network as a basis for
   simulating landscape-scale hydrologic connectivity and catchment runoff.
   Hydrologic connectivity describes shallow water table continuity between
   upland and stream elements of the catchment and is important for the
   movement of water and solutes to streams. This concept has gained
   traction in physical hydrology but has received less attention in
   rainfall-runoff modeling. Our model is based on the empirical studies of
   Jencso et al. (2009, 2010), who found a strong correlation between the
   duration of shallow groundwater connectivity across hillslope, riparian,
   and stream zones and upslope accumulated area. We explored the
   relationship between catchment form and function by testing the extent
   to which streamflow generation could be predicted by a model based on
   the topographic form (distribution of landscape elements) of the
   catchment. We applied the model to the Stringer Creek catchment of the
   Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest, located in Montana, USA. Detailed
   field observations collected by Jencso et al. (2009) were used to inform
   the underpinnings of the model and to corroborate internal consistency
   of the model simulations. The model demonstrated good agreement between
   the observed and predicted streamflow and connectivity duration curves.
   The ability of this model to simulate internal dynamics without
   conditioning the parameters on these data suggests that it has the
   potential to be more confidently extrapolated to other shallow,
   topographically driven catchments than hydrologic models that fail to
   consistently reproduce internal variables.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Hydrologic connectivity is critical to the structure, function, and
   dynamic process of river ecosystems. Dams, road crossings, and water
   diversions impact connectivity by altering flow regimes, behavioral
   cues, local geomorphology, and nutrient cycling. This longitudinal
   fragmentation of river ecosystems also increases genetic and
   reproductive isolation of aquatic biota such as migratory fishes. The
   cumulative effects on fish passage of many structures along a river are
   often substantial, even when individual barriers have negligible impact.
   Habitat connectivity can be improved through dam removal or other means
   of fish passage improvement (e.g., ladders, bypasses, culvert
   improvement). Environmental managers require techniques for comparing
   alternative fish passage restoration actions at alternative or multiple
   locations. Herein, we examined a graph-theoretic algorithm for assessing
   upstream habitat connectivity to investigate both basic and applied fish
   passage connectivity problems. First, we used hypothetical watershed
   configurations to assess general alterations to upstream fish passage
   connectivity with changes in watershed network topology (e.g., linear
   vs. highly dendritic) and the quantity, location, and passability of
   each barrier. Our hypothetical network modeling indicates that locations
   of dams with limited passage efficiency near the watershed outlet create
   a strong fragmentation signal but are not individually sufficient to
   disconnect the system. Furthermore, there exists a threshold in the
   number of dams beyond which connectivity declines precipitously,
   regardless of watershed topology and dam configuration. Watersheds with
   highly branched configurations are shown to be less susceptible to
   disconnection as measured by this metric. Second, we applied the model
   to prioritize barrier improvement in the mainstem of the Truckee River,
   Nevada, USA. The Truckee River application demonstrates the ability of
   the algorithm to address conditions common in fish passage projects
   including incomplete data, parameter uncertainty, and rapid application.
   This study demonstrates the utility of a graph-theoretic approach for
   assessing fish passage connectivity in dendritic river networks assuming
   full basin utilization for a given species, guild, or community of

Abstract = {{Surface digital elevation model (DEM) resolution receives increasing
   attention because of its importance in topographic analysis
   (e.g.,quantification of surface depressions) and hydrologic modeling.
   Varied and even contrary conclusions have been obtained concerning the
   effects of DEM grid size on surface depression properties. Land surfaces
   are featured with a number of microtopography-controlled, localized
   areas, and their connections may significantly alter hydrologic and
   geomorphologic processes. Few efforts have been made to examine the
   effects of DEM resolution on surface depression properties and
   hydrologic connectivity. This study aimed to evaluate such resolution
   effects by two dimensionless parameters: the DEM representation scale
   (the ratio of DEM grid size to correlation length, representing
   horizontal resolution) and the surface roughness scale (the ratio of
   random roughness to correlation length, representing vertical
   topographic variability). A puddle delineation program was utilized to
   quantify depression properties for a variety of topographic surfaces
   characterized by different DEM resolutions, including small-scale
   surfaces with random roughness, field plots, and watershed surfaces. In
   particular, a puddle-to-puddle (P2P) conceptual model was used for
   hydrologic connectivity analysis. It was found that puddle properties
   depended on both dimensionless and . The significantly influenced the
   calculations of structural and functional hydrologic connectivity. Using
   DEMs with a coarser resolution or higher tended to overestimate
   hydrologic connectivity and simplified hydrograph for a surface with
   numerous small-scale depressions. The DEM resolution or dimensionless
   had significant influences on the development of functional hydrologic
   connectivity, especially at the early stage of the rainfall-runoff
   process. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrologic connectivity is fundamental to understanding floodplain
   processes along meandering river corridors. This study contributes to
   understanding hydrologic connectivity by utilizing a high resolution
   Light Detection and Ranging DEM with a new GIS-based approach for
   identifying the precise elevation of flood stage. The method created a
   high-resolution longitudinal channel bank profile, enabling a detailed
   examination of embanked floodplain hydrologic connectivity. A simple
   channel cross-section approach is likely to result in a large
   underestimation of floodplain inundation and hydrologic connectivity
   along meandering river floodplains because of differences in the
   elevation of the natural levee surface relative to floodplain bottoms
   and the considerable variability in the elevation of the channel bank
   profile. There is a large disparity in discharge duration associated
   with floodplain inundation in comparison to river channel bank
   inundation. A discharge duration of 10\% is associated with inundation
   of 87\% of the floodplain surface whereas only 53\% of the channel bank
   profile is overtopped. An apparent threshold in inundation occurs as the
   discharge duration decreases below about 35\%. While a duration of 25\%
   results in very little of the channel bank being overtopped, it
   inundates 50\% of the floodplain surface. Floodplain borrow pits, which
   are created in association with dike construction, represent a constant
   anthropogenic influence on the lower Mississippi embanked floodplain
   morphology, and are inundated by low discharge magnitudes. The results

Abstract = {{Prairie pothole lakes (PPLs) are glacially derived, ecologically
   important water bodies found in central North America and represent a

   the photochemical fate of pesticides entering PPLs are largely unknown.
   In this study, the photodegradation of sixteen pesticides was
   investigated in PPL waters sampled from North Dakota, under simulated
   and natural sunlight. Enhanced pesticide removal rates in the irradiated
   PPL water relative to the control buffer pointed to the importance of
   indirect photolysis pathways involving photochemically produced reactive
   intermediates (PPRIs). The steady-state concentrations of carbonate
   radical, hydroxyl radical, singlet oxygen, and triplet-excited state DOM
   were measured and second-order rate constants for reactions of

Abstract = {{Quantifying spatial and temporal dynamics of organic matter (OM) is
   critical both for understanding ecosystem functioning and for predicting
   impacts of landscape change. To determine the influence of different
   habitats and coarse particulate OM (CPOM) types upon floodplain OM
   dynamics, we quantified aerial input, lateral surface transfer, and
   surface storage of CPOM over an annual cycle on the near-natural
   floodplain of the River Tagliamento in NE-Italy. Using these data, we
   modelled floodplain leaf dynamics, taking account of the spatial
   distribution and hydrologic connectivity of habitats, and using leaf
   storage as a response variable. Mean aerial CPOM input to the floodplain
   was similar from riparian forest and islands, but surface transfer was
   greater from islands, supporting the suggestion that these habitats act
   as ``islands of fertility{''} along braided rivers. Leaves were the
   lateral conveyor of energy to more open parts of the floodplain, whereas
   CPOM was mainly stored as small wood in vegetated islands and riparian
   forest. Simulating the loss of habitat diversity (islands, ponds)
   decreased leaf storage on the whole floodplain, on exposed gravel and in
   large wood accumulations. In contrast, damming (loss of islands, ponds
   and floods plus floodplain overgrowth) greatly increased storage on
   exposed gravel. A random shuffle of habitats led to a storage increase
   on exposed gravel, while that in large wood accumulations and ponds
   declined. These results disentangle some of the complexities of CPOM
   dynamics in floodplain ecosystems, illustrate the value of models in
   understanding ecosystem functioning at a landscape level, and directly

Abstract = {{Greater connectivity to stream surface water may result in greater

   connectivity to stream water on soil nutrient fluxes in plots (n = 20)
   located among four created and two natural freshwater wetlands of
   varying hydrology in the Piedmont physiographic province of Virginia.
   Surface water was slightly deeper; hydrologic inputs of sediment,
   sediment-N, and ammonium were greater; and soil net ammonification, N
   mineralization, and N turnover were greater in plots with stream water
   classified as their primary water source compared with plots with
   precipitation or groundwater as their primary water source. Soil
   water-filled pore space, inputs of nitrate, and soil net nitrification,
   P mineralization, and denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) were similar
   among plots. Soil ammonification, N mineralization, and N turnover rates
   increased with the loading rate of ammonium to the soil surface.
   Phosphorus mineralization and ammonification also increased with
   sedimentation and sediment-N loading rate. Nitrification flux and DEA
   were positively associated in these wetlands. In conclusion, hydrologic
   connectivity to stream water increased allochthonous inputs that
   stimulated soil N and P cycling and that likely led to greater retention
   of sediment and nutrients in created and natural wetlands. Our findings
   suggest that wetland creation and restoration projects should be
   designed to allow connectivity with stream water if the goal is to
   optimize the function of water quality improvement in a watershed.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale cattle and crop production are the primary drivers of

   stream ecosystems by reducing connectivity, changing light and nutrient
   inputs, and altering the quantity and quality of streamwater. This study
   integrates field data from 12 catchments with satellite-derived
   information for the 176 000 km(2) upper Xingu watershed (Mato Grosso,
   Brazil). We quantify recent land-use transitions and evaluate the
   influence of land management on streamwater temperature, an important
   determinant of habitat quality in small streams. By 2010, over 40 per
   cent of catchments outside protected areas were dominated (greater than
   60\% of area) by agriculture, with an estimated 10 000 impoundments in
   the upper Xingu. Streams in pasture and soya bean watersheds were
   significantly warmer than those in forested watersheds, with average
   daily maxima over 4 degrees C higher in pasture and 3 degrees C higher
   in soya bean. The upstream density of impoundments and riparian forest
   cover accounted for 43 per cent of the variation in temperature. Scaling
   up, our model suggests that management practices associated with recent
   agricultural expansion may have already increased headwater stream

   negatively impact stream biota, conserving or restoring riparian buffers
   could reduce predicted warming by as much as fivefold.}},

Abstract = {{Boreal ecosystems represent a large carbon (C) reservoir and a
   substantial source of greenhouse gases. Hydrologic conditions dictate
   whether C leached from boreal soils is processed in catchments or
   flushed to less productive environments via the stream. This study
   quantified hydrologic and biogeochemical C loss from a boreal catchment
   underlain by frozen silt, where flowpaths may deepen as the active layer
   thaws over the summer. We hypothesized a decrease in the magnitude of C
   mineralization over the summer associated with changing flowpaths and
   decreasing hydrologic connectivity, organic matter lability, and
   nitrogen (N) availability. Conservative tracers were used to partition C
   and N loss between catchment export and biogeochemical processing.
   Coupling tracers with tributary and porewater chemistry indicated C and
   N cycling in soil flowpaths, with an exponential decrease over the
   summer. Nitrate was primarily reduced in hillslope flowpaths and the
   lack of N reaching the stream appeared to limit C mineralization. Stream
   export accounted for the greatest loss of C, removing 247 and 113mol
   hr(-1) in the early and late summer, respectively. Reactivity was
   related to hydrologic connectivity between the soils and stream, which
   was greatest early in the summer and following a large flood. While a
   warming climate may increase storage potential in thawed soils, the
   early-season flush of labile material and late-season runoff through
   mineral flowpaths may maintain high C export rates. Therefore, we
   highlight physical export as a dominant cause of aqueous C loss from
   silty catchments as the Arctic continues to thaw.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural straw, hydromulch, and wood shred or wood strand mulches
   increasingly are being used as post-fire hillslope treatments, but the
   differences in effectiveness among these mulch treatments are not fully
   understood. Following the 2002 Hayman fire in central Colorado and the
   2003 Cedar fire in southern California, matched catchments were
   monitored for five to seven post-fire years to determine the
   effectiveness of wheat straw mulch (Hayman fire only) and hydromulch in
   reducing post-fire runoff, peak flow rates, and sediment yields from
   natural rainfall. Measured runoff and sediment yields were caused by
   short duration high intensity summer storms at the Hayman fire and long
   duration winter rains at the Cedar fire.
   The wheat straw mulch treatment significantly reduced peak flow rates
   and sediment yields at the Hayman fire. The annual peak flow rates in
   the first two post-fire years in the straw mulch catchment were 4.5 and
   3.9 m(3) s(-1) km(-2) (respectively) as compared to 4.3 and 7.1 m(3)
   s(-1) km(-2) (respectively) in the control. In post-fire years one and
   two, the maximum event sediment yields in the straw mulch catchment were
   7.2 and 10 Mg ha(-1), respectively, which were less than half of the
   maximum event sediment yields in the control catchment (19 and 24 Mg
   ha(-1), respectively). The straw mulch catchment had no detectable
   runoff or sediment yield after the second post-fire year, but the
   control catchment continued to have measurable runoff and sediment
   yields through the seventh post-fire year. The straw mulch treatment
   effect in runoff reduction was not Significant in the statistical model.
   Total ground cover was 80\% immediately after the application of straw
   mulch, and decreased to 10\% by the end of first post-fire year, yet
   total ground cover values remained high as litter and vegetation,
   including invasive cheatgrass, increased.
   The hydromulch cover at both fires declined rapidly and provided less
   than 10\% of the ground cover within 2.5 months after application at
   which point the catchment was presumed to be untreated. Due to
   differences in precipitation, the three catchments at the Cedar fire had
   significantly different hydrologic responses during the presumed
   untreated portion of the study, which precluded evaluation of treatment
   effectiveness during the short treated period. The peak flow responses
   from the hydromulch and control catchments at the Hayman fire were also
   different during the presumed untreated period and were not tested.
   Although the runoff and sediment yields did not differ during the
   presumed untreated period and were tested for treatment effects, the
   Hayman hydromulch treatment did not significantly affect either response
   during the first post-fire year the presumed treated period.
   Unit-area sediment yields from the catchments were similar to those
   measured on hillslope plots at both the Hayman and Cedar fires in the
   first post-fire years, but in later years the sediment yields from the
   catchments were at least double the sediment yields measured on
   hillslope plots. The longer periods of greater erosion rates in the
   catchments likely reflect the addition of channel erosion processes and
   a difference in hydrologic connectivity at the catchment scale.

Abstract = {{Maintaining or restoring connectivity in aquatic systems can enhance
   migratory fish populations; maintain genetic diversity in small,
   isolated populations; allow organisms to access complementary habitats
   to meet life-history needs; and facilitate recolonization after local
   extirpations. However, intentional fragmentation may be beneficial when
   it prevents the spread of nonnative species or exotic diseases,
   eliminates hybridization between hatchery and wild stocks, or stops
   individuals from becoming entrapped in sink environments. Strategies for
   fragmenting aquatic systems include maintaining existing natural
   barriers, taking advantage of existing anthropogenic features that
   impede movement, severing artificial connectivity created by human
   actions, and intentionally creating new barriers. Future challenges for
   managing fragmentation include maintaining hydrologic connectivity while
   blocking biological connectivity in water development projects;
   identifying approaches for maintaining incompatible taxa, such as sport
   fishes and small nongame species; and developing selective barriers that
   prevent the passage of unwanted species while allowing normal

Abstract = {{Spatially distributed nonpoint source (NPS) pollution indices are used
   to identify areas in a watershed where potential pollutant loading
   coincides with runoff generating areas. However, most such indices
   either ignore the degree of hydrologic connectivity to the stream
   network or they estimate it based simply on the distance of the
   pollution generating area from an open channel. We propose an NPS
   pollution index based on runoff travel times from saturated variable
   source areas (VSAs) to the natural stream network as a means for
   including hydrologic connectivity between source areas and streams.
   Although this method could be generalized to any pollutant transported
   by storm runoff, here we focus on phosphorus and refer to the index as
   the travel-time phosphorus index (TTPI). The TTPI was applied to a 38
   km(2) agricultural watershed in central New York and shown to yield
   realistic, spatially explicit predictions of critical phosphorus loading
   areas and routing pathways. One interesting finding is the potential
   role of man-made drainage networks (e.g., road- or agricultural-ditches)
   in NPS pollution and the possibilities of targeting water quality
   protection practices around or within these networks. Because the
   technique is GIS-based, relatively simple to apply, uses readily
   available geospatial data, and the theoretical underpinnings are
   transparent, it can provide a useful screening tool for water resource
   managers charged with the identification and remediation of critical NPS

Abstract = {{Human activities are rapidly increasing the global supply of reactive N
   and substantially altering the structure and hydrologic connectivity of
   managed ecosystems. There is long-standing recognition that N must be
   removed along hydrologic flow paths from uplands to streams, yet it has
   proven difficult to assess the generality of this removal across
   ecosystem types and whether these patterns are influenced by land use
   change. To assess how well upland nitrate (NO3-) loss is reflected in
   stream export, we gathered information from >50 watershed biogeochemical
   studies that reported nitrate concentrations ({[}NO3-]) for stream water
   and for either upslope soil solution or groundwater NO3- to examine
   whether stream export of NO3- accurately reflects upland NO3- losses. In
   this data set, soil solution and stream water {[}NO3-] were correlated
   across 40 undisturbed forest watersheds, with stream water {[}NO3-]
   typically half (median = 50\%) soil solution {[}NO3-]. A similar
   relationship was seen in 10 disturbed forest watersheds. However, for 12
   watersheds with significant agricultural or urban development, the
   intercept and slope were both significantly higher than the relationship
   seen in forest watersheds. Differences in concentration between soil
   solution or groundwater and stream water may be attributed to biological
   uptake, microbial processes including denitrification, and/or
   preferential flow routing. The results of this synthesis are consistent
   with the hypotheses that undisturbed watersheds have a significant
   capacity to remove nitrate after it passes below the rooting zone and
   that land use changes tend to alter the efficiency or the length of
   watershed flow paths, leading to reductions in nitrate removal and
   increased stream nitrate concentrations. Citation: Sudduth, E. B., S. S.

Abstract = {{During an 11-day period in August 2008, we visited 102 sites along the
   nearshore (similar to 60 km) of Long Point Bay. The purpose of our study
   was to evaluate the effects of wave exposure and hydrologic connectivity
   on zooplankton distributions. Long Point is located within the UNESCO
   Long Point Biosphere Reserve (26250 ha) and encompasses the largest
   wetland complex in the Great Lakes system. We sampled for zooplankton,
   aquatic vegetation, temperature, specific conductance, pH, dissolved
   oxygen, dissolved organic carbon, water clarity, total nitrogen and
   depth. We evaluated the impacts of exposure using wind and fetch data to
   calculate a Relative Exposure Index (REI). Ordination techniques
   revealed a large variation in physical disturbance, water clarity,
   nutrient concentrations, water chemistry and aquatic vegetation that
   explained the distribution pattern of zooplankton at the 102 sites.
   Gradients of REI are strongly positively correlated with environmental
   variables, such as pH, dissolved oxygen and temperature and highly
   negatively correlated with conductivity and dissolved organic carbon.
   Visual inspection of the ordination site scores revealed the 102 sites
   clustering into six main groups based on spatial location and degree of
   surface-water connectivity to Long Point Bay. Sheltered sites (low REI)
   have much higher abundance of zooplankton whereas sites that have high
   REI scores are characterized by relatively low zooplankton abundance
   with a high prevalence of Polyarthra sp. This is the largest study on

Abstract = {{Maintaining the ecological diversity and hydrologic connectivity of
   freshwater delta systems depends on regular recharge of floodplains with
   river water, which can be difficult to observe on the ground. Rivers
   that form deltas often carry large amounts of suspended sediment, but
   floodplain lakes and wetlands usually have little sediment in
   suspension. Remote observation of high sediment water in lakes and
   wetlands therefore often indicates connectivity with the river network.
   In this study, we use daily 250-m MODIS imagery in band 1 (620-670 nm)
   and band 2 (841-876 nm) to monitor suspended sediment transport and, by
   proxy, hydrologic recharge in the Peace-Athabasca Delta, Canada. To
   identify an appropriate suspended sediment concentration
   (SSC)-reflectance model, we compare 31 published empirical equations
   using a field dataset containing 147 observations of SSC and in situ
   spectral reflectance. Results suggest potential for spatial
   transferability of such models, but success is contingent on the
   equation meeting certain criteria: 1) use of a near infrared band in
   combination with at least one visible band, 2) development based on SSCs
   similar to those in the observed region, and 3) a nonlinear form. Using
   a highly predictive SSC-reflectance model (Spearman's rho = 0.95), we
   develop a twelve-year time series of SSC in the westernmost end of Lake
   Athabasca, observe the timing and sources of major sediment flux events,
   and identify a threshold river discharge of similar to 1700 m(3)/s above
   which SSC in Lake Athabasca is clearly associated with flow in the
   Athabasca River. We also track the influx of Athabasca River water to
   floodplain lakes, and in three of the lakes identify distinct discharge
   thresholds (1040 m(3)/s, 1150 m(3)/s, and 1850 m(3)/s) which result in
   lake recharge. For each of these lakes, we find a statistically
   significant decline in the threshold exceedence frequency since 1970,
   suggesting less frequent recharge during the summer. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The distribution and movement of water can influence the state and
   dynamics of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems through a diversity of
   mechanisms. These mechanisms can be organized into three general
   categories wherein water acts as (1) a resource or habitat for biota,
   (2) a vector for connectivity and exchange of energy, materials, and
   organisms, and (3) as an agent of geomorphic change and disturbance.
   These latter two roles are highlighted in current models, which
   emphasize hydrologic connectivity and geomorphic change as determinants
   of the spatial and temporal distributions of species and processes in
   river systems. Water availability, on the other hand, has received less
   attention as a driver of ecological pattern, despite the prevalence of
   intermittent streams, and strong potential for environmental change to
   alter the spatial extent of drying in many regions. Here we summarize
   long-term research from a Sonoran Desert watershed to illustrate how
   spatial patterns of ecosystem structure and functioning reflect shifts
   in the relative importance of different `roles of water' across scales
   of drainage size. These roles are distributed and interact
   hierarchically in the landscape, and for the bulk of the drainage
   network it is the duration of water availability that represents the
   primary determinant of ecological processes. Only for the largest
   catchments, with the most permanent flow regimes, do flood-associated
   disturbances and hydrologic exchange emerge as important drivers of
   local dynamics. While desert basins represent an extreme case, the
   diversity of mechanisms by which the availability and flow of water
   influence ecosystem structure and functioning are general. Predicting
   how river ecosystems may respond to future environmental pressures will
   require clear understanding of how changes in the spatial extent and
   relative overlap of these different roles of water shape ecological
   patterns.}},

Abstract = {{The maintenance of hydrologic connectivity in river networks has become
   an important principle for guiding management and conservation planning
   for threatened salmon populations, yet our understanding of how fish
   movement is impaired by spatial and temporal variation in connectivity
   remains limited. In this study, a two-dimensional hydraulic modelling
   approach is presented to evaluate flow connectivity in relation to
   passage requirements of adult steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in
   coastal California streams. High-resolution topographic data of stream
   reaches with distinct channel morphology were collected using
   terrestrial light detection and ranging surveys and linked with water
   surface measurements to calibrate hydraulic model simulations.
   Quantitative metrics of longitudinal flow connectivity were developed to
   assess fish passage suitability in relation to stream discharge.
   Measured flow data from the 20082009 winter season and simulated
   long-term records indicated that suitable passage flows occur with
   relatively low frequency and duration at all sites, suggesting that
   instream flow protections for fish passage are warranted. Results from
   the hydraulic modelling simulations were then compared with two
   alternative methods for assessing passage flows. A regional formula used
   by the State of California to identify minimum instream flow needs
   provided conservative estimates of passage flow requirements, whereas an
   approach based on riffle crest water depths underestimated flow needs.
   The hydraulic modelling approach appears well suited for simulating
   flows for fish passage studies and may be particularly useful for
   testing alternative environmental flow assessment methods and evaluating
   habitatflow relationships in stream reaches of importance, such as
   critical habitat for threatened fish species. Copyright (c) 2011 John

Abstract = {{Hydrograph recession during dry periods has been used to construct water

   the values of beta are relatively stable during a recession event. The
   values of beta are negatively correlated with the water table depth and

Abstract = {{Hydrologic connectivity can be an important driver of aquatic

   We evaluated the effects of lateral hydrologic connectivity (permanently

   environmental variables on aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages and
   functional feeding groups (FFGs) in freshwater, brackish, and saline

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{17}},

Pages = {{761-781}},
Abstract = {{The management of sediment and other non-point source (NPS) pollution
   has proven difficult, and requires a sound understanding of particle
   movement through the drainage system. The primary objective of this
   investigation was to obtain an understanding of NPS sediment source(s),
   transport, and storage within the Mkabela Basin, a representative
   agricultural catchment within the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands of eastern
   South Africa, by combining geomorphic, hydrologic and geochemical
   fingerprinting analyses.
   The Mkabela Basin can be subdivided into three distinct subcatchments
   that differ in their ability to transport and store sediment along the
   axial valley. Headwater (upper catchment) areas are characterized by
   extensive wetlands that act as significant sediment sinks. Mid-catchment
   areas, characterized by higher relief and valley gradients, exhibit few
   wetlands, but rather are dominated by a combination of alluvial and
   bedrock channels that are conducive to sediment transport. The lower
   catchment exhibits a low-gradient alluvial channel that is boarded by
   extensive riparian wetlands that accumulate large quantities of sediment
   (and NPS pollutants).
   Fingerprinting studies suggest that silt-and clay-rich layers found
   within wetland and reservoir deposits of the upper and upper-mid
   subcatchments are derived from the erosion of fine-grained, valley
   bottom soils frequently utilized as vegetable fields. Coarser-grained
   deposits within these wetlands and reservoirs result from the erosion of
   sandier hillslope soils extensively utilized for sugar cane, during
   relatively high magnitude runoff events that are capable of transporting
   sand-sized sediment off the slopes. Thus, the source of sediment to the
   axial valley varies as a function of sediment size and runoff magnitude.
   Sediment export from upper to lower catchment areas was limited until
   the early 1990s, in part because the upper catchment wetlands were
   hydrologically disconnected from lower parts of the watershed during low
   to moderate flood events. The construction of a drainage ditch through a
   previously unchanneled wetland altered the hydrologic connectivity of
   the catchment, allowing sediment to be transported from the headwaters
   to the lower basin where much of it was deposited within riparian
   wetlands. The axial drainage system is now geomorphically and
   hydrologically connected during events capable of overflowing dams
   located throughout the study basin. The study indicates that increased
   valley connectivity partly negated the positive benefits of controlling
   sediment/nutrient exports from the catchment by means of upland based,

Abstract = {{Understanding the role of connectivity for the characterization of
   heterogeneous porous aquifers or reservoirs is a very active and new
   field of research. In that framework, connectivity metrics are becoming
   important tools to describe a reservoir. In this paper, we provide a
   review of the various metrics that were proposed so far, and we classify
   them in four main groups. We define first the static connectivity
   metrics which depend only on the connectivity structure of the parameter
   fields (hydraulic conductivity or geological facies). By contrast,
   dynamic connectivity metrics are related to physical processes such as
   flow or transport. The dynamic metrics depend on the problem
   configuration and on the specific physics that is considered. Most
   dynamic connectivity metrics are directly expressed as a function of an
   upscaled physical parameter describing the overall behavior of the
   media. Another important distinction is that connectivity metrics can
   either be global or localized. The global metrics are not related to a
   specific location while the localized metrics relate to one or several
   specific points in the field. Using these metrics to characterize a
   given aquifer requires the possibility to measure dynamic connectivity
   metrics in the field, to relate them with static connectivity metrics,
   and to constrain models with those information. Some tools are already
   available for these different steps and reviewed here, but they are not
   yet routinely integrated in practical applications. This is why new
   steps should be added in hydrogeological studies to infer the
   connectivity structure and to better constrain the models. These steps
   must include specific field methodologies, interpretation techniques,
   and modeling tools to provide more realistic and more reliable forecasts
   in a broad range of applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{75-94}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Conceptual models of river-floodplain systems and biogeochemical theory
   predict that floodplain soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)
   mineralization should increase with hydrologic connectivity to the river
   and thus increase with distance downstream (longitudinal dimension) and
   in lower geomorphic units within the floodplain (lateral dimension). We
   measured rates of in situ soil net ammonification, nitrification, N, and
   P mineralization using monthly incubations of modified resin cores for a
   year in the forested floodplain wetlands of Difficult Run, a fifth order
   urban Piedmont river in Virginia, USA. Mineralization rates were then
   related to potentially controlling ecosystem attributes associated with
   hydrologic connectivity, soil characteristics, and vegetative inputs.
   Ammonification and P mineralization were greatest in the wet backswamps,
   nitrification was greatest in the dry levees, and net N mineralization
   was greatest in the intermediately wet toe-slopes. Nitrification also
   was greater in the headwater sites than downstream sites, whereas
   ammonification was greater in downstream sites. Annual net N
   mineralization increased with spatial gradients of greater ammonium
   loading to the soil surface associated with flooding, soil organic and
   nutrient content, and herbaceous nutrient inputs. Annual net P
   mineralization was associated negatively with soil pH and coarser soil
   texture, and positively with ammonium and phosphate loading to the soil
   surface associated with flooding. Within an intensively sampled low
   elevation flowpath at one site, sediment deposition during individual
   incubations stimulated mineralization of N and P. However, the amount of
   N and P mineralized in soil was substantially less than the amount
   deposited with sedimentation. In summary, greater inputs of nutrients
   and water and storage of soil nutrients along gradients of
   river-floodplain hydrologic connectivity increased floodplain soil
   nutrient mineralization rates.}},

Abstract = {{Water flow management has significantly changed the natural dynamic of
   floods, `which are responsible for the structure and dynamic of aquatic
   communities in river-floodplain systems. With the aim to elaborate a
   conceptual framework that describes the main ecological factors
   associated with zooplankton community structure in the Upper Parana
   River, we investigated the mechanisms that regulate the communities
   structure and their response to inter-annual and hydro-sedimentological
   variations in the floodplain and the biological factors associated with
   species abundance in those communities. For this we conducted samplings
   every six months (potamophase in March and limnophase in September) to
   characterize intra and inter-annual variations in community structure
   between 2000 and 2008. The intra-annual differences on the species
   richness, abundance, Shannon diversity index, and evenness, were
   conducted using Bayesian procedures to show probabilistic predictions of
   the data fit to main variation sources. Non-metric multi-dimensional
   scaling (NMDS), multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP), and
   indicator species analysis (IndVal) were run to assess and characterize
   the seasonality of the community structure. During high water
   (potamophase), hydrologic connectivity favoured exchange and dispersal
   of species in some lakes, increasing local diversity; during low water
   (limnophase), higher local productivity favoured opportunistic taxa,
   increasing species dominance and decreasing local diversity. Food
   resources and density of small-size fish were biological factors
   associated with the seasonal dynamic of the zooplankton community; these
   factors were dependent on hydrosedimentological phase (potamophase or
   limnophase). Water levels and limnological modifications related to
   water flow management have promoted replacement and impoverishment of
   aquatic biota in affected lakes and have indicated the ecological
   importance of a natural dynamic flood, which displays regular flood
   pulses. The conceptual model presented encompassed interactions between
   diverse environmental variables to more understandable mechanisms of the
   main sources of community variation. Rev. Biol. Trop. 60 (4): 1819-1836.

Abstract = {{Electrical resistance sensors are used as a novel approach to quantify
   streamflow continuity (continuous through time) and longitudinal
   connectivity (continuous through space) across watersheds in
   south-eastern Arizona, USA. We demonstrate this approach by reporting on
   a spatial array of 21 sensors installed in streams supporting naturally
   perennial, intermittent and ephemeral flow on the US Army Garrison, Fort
   Huachuca. Continuity and connectivity were quantified based on a strict
   interpretation of continuous flow at an individual sensor (strict
   continuity) or simultaneous streamflow at multiple sensors (strict
   connectivity). In addition, we evaluated continuity and connectivity to
   include periods (<48?h) when in-channel refuges may exist between
   streamflow events (refuge-maintained continuity and connectivity).
   Continuous streamflow in intermittent reaches accounted for 34\% of the
   121-day monitoring period (15 April13 August 2010) and 28\% of the
   summer monsoon period (1 July13 August 2010). Streamflow in ephemeral
   reaches accounted for 1.5\% and 2.3\% of the entire monitoring and
   monsoon period, respectively. Canyon-wide longitudinal connectivity was
   rare (<1\%); however, substantial longitudinal connection occurred along
   extensive portions of individual canyons. The refuge-maintained criteria
   increased continuity 28\%, with less influence on connectivity (e.g.
   <3\% increase in only some portions of canyons). Despite this result,
   the refuge-maintained concept remains important because of its broad
   applicability to refuge persistence across aquatic species and
   hydro-climatic regimes. The approach presented in this study supports
   the growing scientific research on the influence of longitudinal
   hydrologic connectivity on population dynamics and ecological processes

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Quantifying hydrologic and ecological connectivity has contributed to
   understanding transport and dispersal processes and assessing ecosystem
   degradation or restoration potential. However, there has been little
   synthesis across disciplines. The growing field of ecohydrology and
   recent recognition that loss of hydrologic connectivity is leading to a
   global decline in biodiversity underscore the need for a unified
   connectivity concept. One outstanding need is a way to quantify
   directional connectivity that is consistent, robust to variations in
   sampling, and transferable across scales or environmental settings.
   Understanding connectivity in a particular direction (e.g., streamwise,
   along or across gradient, between sources and sinks, along cardinal
   directions) provides critical information for predicting contaminant
   transport, planning conservation corridor design, and understanding how
   landscapes or hydroscapes respond to directional forces like wind or
   water flow. Here we synthesize progress on quantifying connectivity and
   develop a new strategy for evaluating directional connectivity that
   benefits from use of graph theory in ecology and percolation theory in
   hydrology. The directional connectivity index (DCI) is a graph-theory
   based, multiscale metric that is generalizable to a range of different
   structural and functional connectivity applications. It exhibits minimal
   sensitivity to image rotation or resolution within a given range and
   responds intuitively to progressive, unidirectional change. Further, it
   is linearly related to the integral connectivity scale length-a metric
   common in hydrology that correlates well with actual fluxes-but is less
   computationally challenging and more readily comparable across different
   landscapes. Connectivity-orientation curves (i.e., directional
   connectivity computed over a range of headings) provide a quantitative,
   information-dense representation of environmental structure that can be
   used for comparison or detection of subtle differences in the
   physical-biological feedbacks driving pattern formation. Case-study
   application of the DCI to the Everglades in south Florida revealed that
   loss of directional hydrologic connectivity occurs more rapidly and is a
   more sensitive indicator of declining ecosystem function than other
   metrics (e.g., habitat area) used previously. Here and elsewhere,
   directional connectivity can provide insight into landscape drivers and
   processes, act as an early-warning indicator of environmental
   degradation, and serve as a planning tool or performance measure for
   conservation and restoration efforts.}},

Abstract = {{The identification of the capacity of a run-of-river plant which allows
   for the optimal utilization of the available water resources is a
   challenging task, mainly because of the inherent temporal variability of
   river flows. This paper proposes an analytical framework to describe the
   energy production and the economic profitability of small run-of-river
   power plants on the basis of the underlying streamflow regime. We
   provide analytical expressions for the capacity which maximize the
   produced energy as a function of the underlying flow duration curve and
   minimum environmental flow requirements downstream of the plant intake.
   Similar analytical expressions are derived for the capacity which
   maximize the economic return deriving from construction and operation of
   a new plant. The analytical approach is applied to a minihydro plant
   recently proposed in a small Alpine catchment in northeastern Italy,
   evidencing the potential of the method as a flexible and simple design
   tool for practical application. The analytical model provides useful
   insight on the major hydrologic and economic controls (e.g., streamflow
   variability, energy price, costs) on the optimal plant capacity and
   helps in identifying policy strategies to reduce the current gap between
   the economic and energy optimizations of run-of-river plants.}},

Abstract = {{The extent and variability of water storage and residence times
   throughout the open water season in beaded arctic streams are poorly
   understood. Data collected in Imnavait Creek, a beaded stream located
   north of the Brooks Range in Alaska, were used to better understand the
   effects of in-pool and riparian storage on heat and mass movement
   through beaded streams. Temperature data of high spatial resolution
   within the pools and surrounding sediments were used with volumetric
   discharge and electrical conductivity to identify storage areas within
   the pools, banks, and other marshy areas within the riparian zone,
   including subsurface flow paths that connect the pools. These subsurface
   flows were found to alter water conductivity and the character of
   dissolved organic matter (DOM) in short reaches (10 s of m) while
   influencing the chemistry of downstream pools. During low flow periods,
   persistent stratification occurred within the pools due to absorption of
   solar radiation by DOM coupled with permafrost below and low wind stress
   at the pool surface. Additionally, one of the shallow pools (<0.5?m
   depth) remained stratified during higher flow periods and lower
   radiation inputs due to dense subsurface flows entering the bottom of
   the pools. This consistent separation of surface and bottom water masses
   in each pool will increase the travel times through this and similar

   chemistry and material export. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Removing dams and levees to restore hydrologic connectivity and enhance
   ecosystem services such as nutrient removal has been an increasingly
   common management practice. In the present study, the authors assessed
   geochemical and biological changes following engineered levee breaches
   that reconnected eutrophic Upper Klamath Lake and Agency Lake, Oregon,
   USA, to an adjacent, historic wetland that had been under agricultural
   use for the last seven decades. Over the three-year study, the
   reconnected wetland served as a benthic source for both macronutrients
   (dissolved organic carbon {[}DOC], soluble reactive phosphorus {[}SRP],
   and ammonia) and micronutrients (dissolved iron and manganese). The
   magnitude of those benthic sources was similar to or greater than that
   of allochthonous sources. The highest DOC benthic flux to the water
   column occurred immediately after rewetting occurred. It then decreased
   during the present study to levels more similar to the adjacent lake.
   Dissolved ammonia fluxes, initially negative after the levee breaches,
   became consistently positive through the remainder of the study. Nitrate
   fluxes, also initially negative, became negligible two years after the
   levee breaches. In contrast to previous laboratory studies, SRP fluxes
   remained positive, as did fluxes of dissolved iron and manganese. Our
   results indicate that the timescales of chemical changes following
   hydrologic reconnection of wetlands are solute-specific and in some
   cases extend for multiple years beyond the reconnection event. During
   the present study, colonization of the reconnected wetlands by aquatic
   benthic invertebrates gradually generated assemblages similar to those
   in a nearby wetland refuge and provided further evidence of the
   multiyear transition of this area to permanent aquatic habitat. Such
   timescales should be considered when developing water-quality management
   strategies to achieve wetland-restoration goals. Environ. Toxicol. Chem.

Abstract = {{Dryland rivers are globally widespread and regionally important, and
   understanding their ecology is critical for sustaining ecosystem
   processes and biodiversity. The dry tropics are characterized by
   episodic summer rainfall. Most of annual river flow occurs in a short
   period of time, after which rivers typically contract into a series of
   waterholes of varying permanence and hydrologic connectivity. We
   investigated how seasonal environmental factors affected
   macroinvertebrate assemblage composition in dry-tropics rivers at the
   river, site, and habitat scales. We assessed biophysical
   characteristics, including water physicochemistry, riparian-zone
   condition, and macroinvertebrate assemblage composition at 15 sites on 4
   unimpounded rivers in the Burdekin catchment, north Queensland,
   Australia. We used permutational analysis of variance and multiresponse
   permutation procedures to identify differences between a priori groups,
   and illustrated the results with principle components analysis
   (biophysical data) and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (invertebrate
   assemblage data). Biophysical variables were spatially and temporally
   variable, and all rivers and most sites differed significantly.
   Macroinvertebrate assemblages also differed significantly among rivers,
   sites within rivers, habitats, and seasons. Assemblages from the same
   habitat but different sites were more similar than assemblages from
   different habitats within the same site. Thus, the dynamic environment
   of dryland river systems drives naturally dynamic and variable
   macroinvertebrate assemblages across a range of scales. The differences
   among sites from the same river were of particular importance from a
   monitoring standpoint because they indicated that extrapolating
   whole-river condition from a few sampled sites would be difficult.}},

Abstract = {{Spring snowmelt is an important period of mercury (Hg) export from
   watersheds. Limited research has investigated the potential effects of
   climate variability on hydrologic and Hg fluxes during spring snowmelt.
   The purpose of this research was to assess the potential impacts of
   inter-annual climate variability on Hg mobility in forested uplands, as
   well as spatial variability in hillslope hydrology and Hg fluxes. We
   compared hydrological flows, Hg and solute mobility from three adjacent
   hillslopes in the S7 watershed of the Marcell Experimental Forest,
   Minnesota during two very different spring snowmelt periods: one
   following a winter (2009-2010) with severely diminished snow
   accumulation (snow water equivalent (SWE) = 48 mm) with an early melt,
   and a second (2010-2011) with significantly greater winter snow
   accumulation (SWE 98 mm) with average to late melt timing. Observed
   inter-annual differences in total Hg (THg) and dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) yields were predominantly flow-driven, as the proportion by which
   solute yields increased was the same as the increase in runoff.
   Accounting for inter-annual differences in flow, there was no
   significant difference in THg and DOC export between the two snowmelt
   periods. The spring 2010 snowmelt highlighted the important contribution
   of melting soil frost in the timing of a considerable portion of THg
   exported from the hillslope, accounting for nearly 30\% of the THg
   mobilized. Differences in slope morphology and soil depths to the
   confining till layer were important in controlling the large observed
   spatial variability in hydrological flowpaths, transmissivity feedback
   responses, and Hg flux trends across the adjacent hillslopes.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrologic connectivity between different components of a coastal
   marsh is a key wetland structural element and is essential in
   determining habitat value. Salt marshes are often thought of as being
   hydrologically connected via tidal creeks, though water bodies within a
   salt marsh may also be semipermanently disconnected. At a salt marsh in
   Matagorda, Texas, USA, there are many ``isolated{''} ponds, located at
   varying elevations. Our objective was to quantify the hydrologic
   connectivity of spatially isolated ponds at this site. We sampled water
   for salinity and stable isotopes (delta H-2, delta O-18) to determine
   the relative contribution of tidal water and rainfall within each pond.
   We also quantified the water level at which each pond floods its banks
   and connects to other ponds, using a light detection and ranging
   (LIDAR)-based elevation model. We found that pond connectivity was
   driven by multiple factors, of which wind and rainfall were the most
   important. Salinity and isotopic values between any two sampled ponds
   were correlated with the water level elevation at which the ponds
   connected. We conclude that the connectivity of the network, and the
   similarity of water samples within it, profoundly changes when specific
   water level thresholds are exceeded by both fresh water and salt water.}},

Abstract = {{Stream ecotones, specifically the lateral floodplain and subsurface
   hyporheic zone, can be important sites for nitrogen (N) removal via
   denitrification, but their role in streams with constructed floodplains
   has not been examined. We studied denitrification in the hyporheic zone
   and floodplains of an agriculturally influenced headwater stream in
   Indiana, USA, that had floodplains added as part of a ``two-stage
   ditch{''} restoration project. To examine the potential for N removal in
   the hyporheic zone, we seasonally measured denitrification rates and
   nitrate concentrations by depth into the stream sediments. We found that
   nitrate concentration and denitrification rates declined with depth into
   the hyporheic zone, but denitrification was still measureable to a depth
   of at least 20 cm. We also measured denitrification rates on the
   restored floodplains over the course of a flood (pre, during, and
   post-inundation), and also compared denitrification rates between
   vegetated and non-vegetated areas of the floodplain. We found that
   floodplain denitrification rates increased over the course of a
   floodplain inundation event, and that the presence of surface water
   increased denitrification rates when vegetation was present. Stream
   ecotones in midwestern, agriculturally influenced streams have
   substantial potential for N removal via denitrification, particularly
   when they are hydrologically connected with high-nitrate surface water.}},

Abstract = {{The Gambia River of West Africa is a large unobstructed river,
   characterized by a natural flow regime and lateral connectivity across
   its floodplain. Construction of a major dam, however, is planned. We
   compared patterns of fish diversity, habitat use, assemblage structure,
   and the distribution of trophic position and body morphology in riverine
   and floodplain habitats in Niokolo Koba National Park, located
   downstream of the planned dam site. A total of 49 fish species were
   captured, revealing a lognormal distribution as expected for
   species-rich assemblages. Fish species exhibited a range of habitat use
   patterns, from generalist to highly habitat-specific, and appeared to
   migrate laterally among habitats between seasons. Species richness was
   homogenous among habitats in the wet season yet appeared to increase
   with isolation from the main river in the dry season. Fish assemblage
   structure was best explained by the interaction between habitat type and
   season, underlining the importance of the natural flow regime and
   lateral connectivity among floodplain habitats. The abundance of fishes
   having elongate bodies increased with isolation from the main channel in
   the wet season only. The distribution of fishes having compressed
   cross-sectional morphology decreased with isolation from the main
   channel in the dry season only. These patterns of trait distribution
   support the conclusion that variation in hydrologic connectivity
   structures the fish assemblage. Our results suggest that altered flow
   regimes and loss of floodplain habitats after damming could lead to both
   decreased taxonomic and functional diversity of the fish assemblage.}},

Abstract = {{Sky islands are ideal systems for determining the effects of climatic
   oscillations on species distributions and genetic structure. Our study
   focused on montane stonefly populations in the Great Basin of western
   North America. We used niche-based distribution modelling,
   phylogeography and traditional species-based biogeography to test
   several hypotheses as follows: (i) genetic differentiation among
   Doroneuria baumanni populations will be independent of hydrologic
   connectivity (headwater model); (ii) Sky islands were colonized when
   habitat was more continuous and populations likely experienced multiple
   expansions and contractions; (iii) Colonization events were coincident
   with the late Pleistocene and Holocene; and (iv) Shared topography and
   climate history will result in concordant patterns of genetic
   differentiation in D.similar to baumanni and occurrences of 32 stonefly
   species across the region. Overall, FSTs and coalescent-based estimates
   of migration were consistent with the headwater model. Maximum
   likelihood and Bayesian gene trees identified three major nonoverlapping
   east-west clades. Distribution modelling indicated more suitable habitat
   in the Great Basin during the Last Glacial Maximum than at present, but
   none during the last interglacial period. Demographic analyses showed
   evidence of population expansion in one of the three major eastwest
   clades. Intra-clade divergence times (60 000183 000 ybp) were well
   within the late Pleistocene while among-clade divergence times (499
   000719 000 ybp) were deeper. Genetic differentiation in D.similar to
   baumanni and distributions of stonefly species were significantly
   concordant. These results imply that climatic oscillations have played
   major roles in shaping the genetic structure and distributions of Great
   Basin stoneflies, but that divergence among clades occurred much earlier
   than our late Pleistocence/early Holocene predictions.}},

   gradient as an indicator for lateral hydrologic connectivity of
   headwater catchments}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{JUN 13}},
Abstract = {{Lateral water flow in catchments can produce important patterns in water
   and nutrient fluxes and stores and also influences the long-term spatial
   development of forest ecosystems. Specifically, patterns of vegetation
   type and density along hydrologic flow paths can represent a signal of
   the redistribution of water and nitrogen mediated by lateral hydrologic
   flow. This study explores the use of emergent vegetation patterns to
   infer ecohydrologic processes and feedbacks in forested headwater
   catchments. We suggest a hydrologic gradient of vegetation density as an
   indicator of lateral connectivity within headwater catchments. We define
   the hydrologic vegetation gradient (HVG) as the increase of normalized
   difference vegetation index per unit increase of the topographic wetness
   index. HVG are estimated in different headwater catchments in the
   Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory using summer IKONOS imagery. We use
   recession slope analysis with gauge data and a distributed
   ecohydrological model to characterize the patterns of seasonal flow
   regimes within the catchments. Correlations between HVG, catchment
   runoff, early recession parameters, and model parameters show the
   interactive role of vegetation and lateral hydrologic connectivity of
   systems in addition to climatic and geomorphic controls. This suggests
   that HVG effectively represents the level of partitioning between
   localized water use and lateral water flow along hydrologic flow paths,
   especially during the growing season. It also presents the potential to
   use simple remotely sensed hydrologic vegetation gradients as an
   indicator of lateral hydrologic connectivity to extrapolate recession
   behavior and key model parameters of distributed hydrological models for
   ungauged headwater catchments.}},

Abstract = {{Continuing reductions in biodiversity, coupled with limited resources,
   have generated the need to perform triage to maximize success in
   conservation efforts. The development and implementation of a species
   recovery programme requires identifying which population units are most
   vulnerable to extirpation, which are most valuable to conserve, and
   which are most feasibly restored. Based on a review of the recent
   literature, there are few generalized approaches available to guide such
   prioritization procedures, but to adapt one existing method was adapted
   to rank populations of six imperilled, native, warmwater fish species of
   the Gila River basin of Arizona-New Mexico, USA and Sonora, Mexico. The
   approach uses a series of binary questions that consider the biological
   consequences of extinction and whose scores accumulate to rank
   conservation value. With significant adjustment, the approach
   accommodated differences among species, evolutionary ecologies,
   habitats, and conservation problems between Pacific salmon stocks (the
   basis of the original method) and desert fishes of the arid American
   Southwest. A major result of the population prioritization process was
   that some of the highest-ranked populations have poor recovery
   potential, and challenges to recovery are daunting. Isolation management
   (segregation of native from non-native fishes) is considered the primary
   recovery action for the native fauna. The general method appears
   adaptable for application to other conservation situations and taxa, but
   its value will be realized only if it results in implementation of
   in-the-water recovery actions. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Urban ecosystems are constantly evolving, and they are expected to
   change in both space and time with active management or degradation. An
   urban watershed continuum framework recognizes a continuum of engineered
   and natural hydrologic flowpaths that expands hydrologic networks in
   ways that are seldom considered. It recognizes that the nature of
   hydrologic connectivity influences downstream fluxes and transformations
   of carbon, contaminants, energy, and nutrients across 4 space and time
   dimensions. Specifically, it proposes that (1) first order streams are
   largely replaced by urban infrastructure (e.g. storm drains, ditches,
   gutters, pipes) longitudinally and laterally within watersheds, (2)
   there is extensive longitudinal and lateral modification of organic
   carbon and nutrient retention in engineered headwaters (3) there are
   longitudinal downstream pulses in material and energy exports that are
   amplified by interactive land-use and hydrologic variability, (4) there
   are vertical interactions between leaky pipes and ground water that
   influence stream solute transport, (5) the urban watershed continuum is
   a transformer and transporter of materials and energy based on
   hydrologic residence times, and (6) temporally, there is an evolution of
   biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem functions as land use and urban
   infrastructure change over time. We provide examples from the Baltimore
   Ecosystem Study Long-Term Ecological (LTER) site along 4 spatiotemporal
   dimensions. Long-term monitoring indicates that engineered headwaters
   increase downstream subsidies of nitrate, phosphate, sulfate, carbon,
   and metals compared with undeveloped headwaters. There are increased
   longitudinal transformations of carbon and nitrogen from suburban
   headwaters to more urbanized receiving waters. Hydrologic connectivity
   along the vertical dimension between ground water and leaky pipes from
   Baltimore's aging infrastructure elevates stream solute concentrations.
   Across time, there has been increased headwater stream burial, evolving
   stormwater management, and long-term salinization of Baltimore's
   drinking water supply. Overall, an urban watershed continuum framework
   proposes testable hypotheses of how transport/transformation of
   materials and energy vary along a continuum of engineered and natural
   hydrologic flowpaths in space and time. Given interest in transitioning
   from sanitary to sustainable cities, it is necessary to recognize the
   evolving relationship between infrastructure and ecosystem function

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Changes in winter time conditions at high-latitude ecosystems could
   severely affect the carbon exchange processes. Using a 15year stream
   record combined with winter field measurements and laboratory
   experiment, we studied the regulation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   concentration in stream water draining boreal mire during snow melt. The
   most unanticipated finding was that cold soils with deep soil frost
   resulted in increased snow melt DOC concentrations in the stream runoff.
   Wintertime field measurements of DOC concentrations below the mire soil
   frost showed that this phenomenon could be explained by freeze-out of
   DOC giving higher levels of DOC in the soil water below the ice as the
   soil frost developed downwards in the mire. Experimental freezing of
   water with a certain DOC concentration in the laboratory further
   corroborated the freeze-out of DOC. In this experiment, as much as 96\%
   of the DOC was excluded from the ice, whereas the freeze-out in the mire
   was less effective (60\%). The difference between the proportion of DOC
   retained in pure water relative to the proportion retained in peat water
   during freezing is probably due to trapped DOC in the solid peat soil
   matrix. A simple mass-balance model showed that to explain the higher
   stream DOC concentrations during a winter with deep soil frost,
   approximately 0.5\% of the mire area needed to be hydrologically
   connected to the stream discharge. In the stream records, we also found
   that the DOC concentrations during snow melt episodic runoff were
   negatively related to increasing intensity of the snow melt episodes
   (dilution by low DOC snow melt water) and higher previous export of DOC.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of in situ bacterial communities in the hyporheic zone of

   assessed community dynamics in stream sediments and interstitial pore
   water over a two-year period using terminal-restriction fragment length
   polymorphism. Here, we show that sediments remained saturated despite
   months of drought and limited hydrologic connectivity. The intermittency
   of stream surface water affected interstitial pore water communities
   more than hyporheic sediment communities. Seasonal changes in bacterial
   community composition was significantly associated with water
   intermittency, phosphate concentrations, temperature, nitrate and
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. During periods of low- to
   no-surface water, communities changed from being rich in operational
   taxonomic units (OTUs) in isolated surface pools, to a few OTUs overall,
   including an overall decline in both common and rare taxa. Individual
   OTUs were compared between porewater and sediments. A total of 19\% of
   identified OTUs existed in both porewater and sediment samples,
   suggesting that bacteria use hyporheic sediments as a type of refuge
   from dessication, transported through hydrologically connected pore
   spaces. Stream intermittency impacted bacterial diversity on rapid

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{APR 18}},
Abstract = {{Due to rising energy demands and abundant untapped potential, hydropower
   projects are rapidly increasing in the Neotropics. This is especially
   true in the wet and rugged Andean Amazon, where regional governments are
   prioritizing new hydroelectric dams as the centerpiece of long-term
   energy plans. However, the current planning for hydropower lacks
   adequate regional and basin-scale assessment of potential ecological
   impacts. This lack of strategic planning is particularly problematic
   given the intimate link between the Andes and Amazonian flood plain,
   together one of the most species rich zones on Earth. We examined the
   potential ecological impacts, in terms of river connectivity and forest
   loss, of the planned proliferation of hydroelectric dams across all
   Andean tributaries of the Amazon River. Considering data on the full
   portfolios of existing and planned dams, along with data on roads and
   transmission line systems, we developed a new conceptual framework to
   estimate the relative impacts of all planned dams. There are plans for
   151 new dams greater than 2 MW over the next 20 years, more than a 300\%
   increase. These dams would include five of the six major Andean
   tributaries of the Amazon. Our ecological impact analysis classified
   47\% of the potential new dams as high impact and just 19\% as low
   impact. Sixty percent of the dams would cause the first major break in
   connectivity between protected Andean headwaters and the lowland Amazon.
   More than 80\% would drive deforestation due to new roads, transmission
   lines, or inundation. We conclude with a discussion of three major
   policy implications of these findings. 1) There is a critical need for
   further strategic regional and basin scale evaluation of dams. 2) There
   is an urgent need for a strategic plan to maintain Andes-Amazon
   connectivity. 3) Reconsideration of hydropower as a low-impact energy
   source in the Neotropics.}},

   transient storage zone; MC, main channel zone). SLOW subreaches had 45\%
   lower ecosystem-level uptake rate (K, t(-1)) on average, indicating
   reduced uptake efficiency in flow-through wetlands relative to streams.
   The four largest K values (total n = 24) also occurred in REF
   subreaches. TS:MC uptake rate varied (range 0.1-6.0), but MC zones
   consistently accounted for most NO3- uptake by the ecosystem. In turn,
   TS influence was limited by a tradeoff between TS zone uptake rate and
   the strength of TS-MC hydrologic connection (alpha or F-med). Additional
   modeling of published hydrologic parameter sets showed that strong MC
   dominance of uptake (> 75\% of total uptake), at the scale of solute
   release methods (meters to kilometers, hours to days), is common among
   streams and rivers. Our results emphasize that aquatic nutrient
   retention is the outcome of a balance involving nutrient uptake
   efficiency, water residence time, and the strength of hydrologic
   connections between nutrient sources and sinks. This balance restricts
   the influence of hydrologically disconnected biota on nutrient
   transport, and could apply to diverse ecosystem types and sizes.}},

Abstract = {{The Oregon chub Oregonichthys crameri is a small floodplain minnow
   endemic to the Willamette River basin of western Oregon. Historically
   the species was widely abundant and probably relied on periodic floods
   for dispersal and genetic exchange among populations. The species has
   declined substantially in the past 100 years due to habitat alterations
   and the introduction of nonnative species and is currently listed as
   threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Information on the
   level of genetic variation within and among populations did not exist
   when the species was listed or when a recovery plan was being developed.
   In this study, we used a suite of nine microsatellite loci to
   characterize genetic variation within and among 16 sampling locations
   and provide information to help guide future recovery efforts. Even
   though many locations are presently isolated from one another, we
   observed relatively high levels of genetic variation within collections.
   Temporal samples revealed that the levels of genetic variation were
   stable over time despite fluctuations in abundance. Estimates of
   effective population size (N-e) for three sampling locations ranged from
   approximately 120 to 220 and suggest that there is no immediate threat
   from inbreeding or genetic drift. We observed a significant level of
   genetic variation among sampling locations (global F-ST = 0.078) and
   significant differences in allele frequencies among all sampling
   locations. Our results suggest that the different locations represent
   distinct populations of Oregon chub and that greater levels of gene flow
   occur among populations within the Santiam and Middle Fork Willamette
   River subbasins. The information presented in this study will help guide
   Oregon chub recovery efforts, including the refinement of recovery areas
   and future population introduction efforts, and will help address the
   challenge of managing populations largely in isolation from one another
   in order to minimize threats from nonnative species.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive implementation of centre pivot irrigation systems occurred

   southwestern Georgia, USA. Groundwater within this karstic system is in
   direct hydraulic connection with regional streams, many of which are
   incised through the overburden into underlying limestone. We used
   long-term U.S. Geological Survey gaging station data to evaluate
   multiple flow metrics of two tributaries (Ichawaynochaway Creek and
   Spring Creek) in the lower FRB to determine the extent of changes in
   stream behaviour since irrigation practices intensified. We compared
   pre- and post-irrigation flow duration curves, 1-, 7-, and 14-day
   minimum flows, and 8-day (seasonal) and annual baseflow recession
   slopes, in addition to evaluating regional climate data to determine
   whether significant differences existed between the pre- and
   post-irrigation periods. Our results showed significant changes in
   low-flow durations in the post-irrigation record for both gages,
   including a decrease by an order of magnitude for 98\% exceedance flows
   at Spring Creek. Both gages indicated significant reductions in 1-, 7-,
   and 14-day low flows. Eight-day baseflow recession curves (within early
   summer months) and annual baseflow recession curves became significantly
   steeper during the post-irrigation period for Ichawaynochaway Creek. We
   also found that a significant relationship existed between winter and
   summer minimum flows in both streams in the pre-irrigation period which
   was disrupted in post-irrigation years. Regional climate data for the
   study period revealed no significant changes in rainfall totals or
   frequency of drought; however, there was evidence for a shift in

Abstract = {{The McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica are the largest ice-free region on

   seasonal melt from glaciers. For forty years, research emphasis has been
   placed on the larger water bodies, the permanent ice-covered lakes. We
   present results from the first study describing the geochemistry of
   ponds in the higher elevations of Taylor Valley. Unlike the lakes at
   lower elevations, the landscape on which these ponds lie is among the
   oldest in Taylor Valley. These upland ponds wax and wane in size
   depending on the local climatic conditions, and their ionic
   concentrations and isotopic composition vary annually depending on the
   amount of meltwater generated and their hydrologic connectivity. This
   study evaluates the impact of changes in summer climate on the chemistry
   of these ponds. Although pond chemistry reflects the initial meltwater
   chemistry, dissolution and chemical weathering within the stream
   channels, and possibly permafrost fluid input, the primary control is
   the dilution effect of glacier melt during warmer summers. These
   processes lead to differences in solute concentrations and ionic ratios
   between ponds, despite their nearby proximity. The change in size of
   these ponds over time has important consequences on their geochemical
   behaviour and potential to provide water and solutes to the subsurface.}},

Abstract = {{Aim We quantify biotic homogenization of fish fauna caused by the
   elimination of a natural barrier between two freshwater ecoregions. We
   also evaluated fish introductions by different mechanisms such as
   aquaculture, angling and the aquarium trade in the homogenization of
   fish assemblages. The relative importance of native extinctions in the
   homogenization process was assessed by simulating the exclusion of
   threatened species in the data set.
   Location Parana River, south-eastern South America.
   Methods A fish species list of the Parana River Basin was organized in a
   subset of species distributions, according to pre- and
   post-introductions caused by the elimination of the natural barrier and
   by other mechanisms. Biotic homogenization was verified by the use of
   Jaccard's and Bray-Curtis's coefficients, Whittaker's beta diversity
   index, non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) and
   nonparametric tests.
   Results For all subsets of species distributions, we observed an
   increase in the number of non-native species in common related to the
   introductions. Between 40 and 52\% of the species currently present in
   the Upper Parana Basin dispersed upstream from the Lower Parana after
   the construction of Itaipu Dam, including at least 1 class, 2 orders, 4
   families and 16 genera of fish. Jaccard's coefficient between the Upper
   and Lower Parana River increased by 6-7.5\% only considering the Itaipu
   Dam influence and 10.5\% considering all mechanisms of fish
   introductions. More than 50\% of the increase in similarity was caused
   by the elimination of the barrier. Our results indicated functional
   homogenization related to large-bodied Siluriformes (catfish).
   Main conclusions Itaipu Lake flooded a natural barrier and allowed
   hydrologic connectivity between the Upper and Lower Parana River, and
   many fishes of the lower part of the river were able to colonize the
   upper stretches. The homogenization of the two assemblages between these
   adjacent aquatic regions was an unpredicted result of hydropower
   implementation. Introductions by dam can also shift longitudinal and
   latitudinal body size patterns (i.e. Bergmann's rule).}},

   Texas: The influence of geomorphic and climatic controls on the ``flood
   pulse concept{''}}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{414}},

Abstract = {{Hydrologic connectivity between rivers and floodplains is fundamental to
   the ecological integrity of meandering river corridors. This study
   integrates two important concepts in floodplain hydrology; the flood
   pulse concept and the oxbow lake cycle. High temporal resolution
   (0.5-3.0 h) lake level data from vented pressure transducers and river
   discharge data (0.25 h resolution) were utilized to develop standardized
   indices of hydrologic connectivity for two oxbow lakes along the lower
   Guadalupe River, Texas over a 3.4 yr period. The lakes were influenced
   by hydrologic conditions representative of the northwestern Gulf region,
   notably a severe drought and a wet season associated with La Nina and El
   Nino, respectively. Because the data were obtained over the same period
   it enables a direct comparison of surficial hydrologic connectivity
   within the evolutionary geomorphic framework of the oxbow lake cycle.
   A recently (13 yr old) formed oxbow lake was connected 5.9 times per yr
   and an older partially infilled oxbow lake was connected 3.8 times per
   yr during the study period. Each oxbow lake was connected by discharge
   pulses below bankfull discharge, and the signature of hydrologic
   connectivity varied significantly. The flow duration for connectivity
   was 18\% and 3\% for the recently formed and older oxbow lake,
   respectively. Bivariate relations between discharge and lake stage
   varied significantly for the two oxbow lakes. The recently formed oxbow
   lake exhibited highly linear relations between discharge and lake
   levels, and lake drainage closely mirrored flood wave recession. Older
   oxbow lake connectivity was complex, as discharge and lake level
   relations were nonlinear and exhibited pronounced negative hysteresis,
   which increased with sequential flood pulses. While the older oxbow lake
   was more sensitive to short term low flow conditions, both lakes were
   completely desiccated during an extended La Nina influenced drought.
   This indicates a substantial impact to alluvial aquifers, which were
   unable to supply groundwater to oxbow lakes during extended dry periods.
   The ``flood pulse concept{''} applied with only river discharge data is
   overly simplistic and does not adequately characterize hydrologic
   connectivity for distinct types of oxbow lakes along meandering river
   floodplains. With limited lake level data, however, great potential
   exists for development of effective ``integrated floodplain
   management{''} plans that more appropriately considers variable
   hydrologic connectivity inherent within the oxbow lake cycle. (C) 2011

Year = {{2012}},
Pages = {{559-593}},
Abstract = {{Subsurface flow networks have been recognized in recent years as an
   important mechanism for water flow through various hillslopes and
   catchments. The formation, geometry, and dynamics of these networks,
   however, remain poorly understood and challenging to be characterized.
   This chapter provides a comprehensive review on recent advances in
   identifying, characterizing, and modeling subsurface preferential flow
   networks at the hillslope scale, including hydrologic connectivity and
   threshold behavior. While trenching, irrigation and tracer experiments,
   and geophysical imaging have been used to reveal some characteristics of
   these subsurface flow networks, much remains to be done in order to
   develop a network-based predictive hydrologic model. Two proposed
   conceptual models for subsurface lateral flow networks at the hillslope
   scale are 1) connected preferential flow pathways in the soil and 2)
   water flow along permeability contrasts such as the soil-bedrock
   interface and contrasting soil horizon interfaces. Current methods for
   modeling subsurface flow networks include topography-based flow routing,
   stochastic macropore modeling, and percolation-based approach. Better
   tools and techniques are needed for effective and efficient in situ
   determination of subsurface structures and flow dynamics with high
   enough spatial and temporal resolutions. This chapter also highlights
   unresolved questions, and suggests some possible ways forward, including
   the role that hydropedology plays.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the effects of land use changes on flow regime and water
   chemistry of headwater streams in the highlands of Chiapas, a region in
   southern Mexico that has experienced high rates of deforestation in the
   last decades. Samples for water chemistry were collected and discharge
   was measured between September 2007 and August 2008 at eight streams
   that differed in the land uses of their riparian and catchment areas,
   including streams draining protected forested areas. Streams with high
   forest cover (> 70\%) in their catchments maintained flow through the
   year. Streams draining more disturbed catchments exhibited reduced or no
   flow for 4-6 months during the dry season. Nitrate concentrations were
   lower at streams draining forested catchments while highest
   concentrations were measured where conventional agriculture covered a
   high proportion of the catchment and riparian zone. Highest phosphorus
   concentrations occurred at the catchment where poultry manure was
   applied as fertilizer. Differences between forest streams and those
   draining disturbed areas were correlated with the proportion of forest
   and agriculture in the riparian zone. Variation in stream variables
   among sampling dates was lower at the forest sites than at the more
   disturbed study streams. Conversion of forest into agriculture and urban
   areas is affecting flow regime and increasing nutrient concentrations,

   agricultural practices and the alteration of the riparian zone.}},

   Catches ranged from 242.8 tons (1990) to 35.6 ton (1995) with a tendency

Abstract = {{The present study indicates the critical role of hydrologic connectivity

   These waterbodies provide dry-season refugia for plants and animals, are
   a hotspot of productivity, and are a critical part in the subsistence
   economy of many remote Aboriginal communities. We examined seasonal
   changes in water quality and aquatic plant cover of floodplain
   waterholes, and related changes to variation of waterhole depth and
   visitation by livestock. The waterholes showed declining water quality
   through the dry season, which was exacerbated by more frequent cattle
   usage as conditions became progressively drier, which also increased
   turbidity and nutrient concentrations. Aquatic macrophyte biomass was
   highest in the early dry season, and declined as the dry season
   progressed. Remaining macrophytes were flushed out by the first
   wet-season flows, although they quickly re-establish later during the
   wet season. Waterholes of greater depth were more resistant to the
   effects of cattle disturbance, and seasonal flushing of the waterholes
   with wet-season flooding homogenised the water quality and increased
   plant cover of previously disparate waterholes. Therefore, maintaining
   high levels of connectivity between the river and its floodplain is
   vital for the persistence of these waterholes.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{443-463}},
Abstract = {{We provide analytical bounds on convergence rates for a class of
   hydrologic models and consequently derive a complexity measure based on
   the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) generalization theory. The class of
   hydrologic models is a spatially explicit interconnected set of linear
   reservoirs with the aim of representing globally nonlinear hydrologic
   behavior by locally linear models. Here, by convergence rate, we mean
   convergence of the empirical risk to the expected risk. The derived
   measure of complexity measures a model's propensity to overfit data. We
   explore how data finiteness can affect model selection for this class of
   hydrologic model and provide theoretical results on how model
   performance on a finite sample converges to its expected performance as
   data size approaches infinity. These bounds can then be used for model
   selection, as the bounds provide a tradeoff between model complexity and

Abstract = {{This study examined hydropedological patterns and storagedischarge
   relationships towards catchment process understanding at a small
   forested site, the Hermine (Laurentians, Quebec, Canada). The catchment
   is characterized by a steep surface topography and a shallow, irregular,
   low-permeability soil layer (LPSL), thus offering two possible main
   hydrologic drivers for runoff generation and routing. Using spatially
   detailed topographic data of the soil surface and the LPSL, water table
   levels measured at 94 locations on 50 occasions were expressed as 5
   perched groundwater (PGW) storage variables: (i) a binary index
   illustrating the presence/absence of surface water, (ii) a soil
   saturation deficit, (iii) a water table elevation above the LPSL, (iv) a
   classification of sites as being in a dry, filling or spilling
   subsurface depression, and (v) a water table elevation above an
   underlying filled subsurface depression. The most common proxies for PGW
   storage, namely the saturation deficit and the location of surface
   saturated areas, were least appropriate to portray the Hermine catchment
   dynamics. Patterns of PGW storage were initially important during a
   rainstorm to trigger a response at the outlet but then remained
   unchanged even though streamflows continued to increase up to a higher
   order of magnitude. Hydraulically limited water tables were shown to
   exist in some areas, thus hinting towards the coexistence of rapid
   lateral preferential flow and slower subsurface flow. Most importantly,
   discontinuous storagedischarge relationships at the point-scale combined
   into continuous relationships at the catchment-scale, a result which can
   be seen as an emergent property of the Hermine catchment. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) can comprise a large and biologically
   important fraction of total dissolved N in surface water. Biotic and
   abiotic processes result in heterogeneous DON concentrations and
   bioavailability in soils, and as hydrologic connectivity expands and
   flow paths change in watersheds, novel sources of DON can be mobilized
   and transported to surface water. Although the relationship between
   in-stream DOC concentration and stream discharge has previously been
   examined in the literature, up to now there has not been a synthesis
   examining how DON concentrations, loads, and composition change during
   transitions from base flow to pulse flow conditions. We present a
   meta-analysis examining the effect of high flow on DON concentration
   ({[}DON]). The ratio of mean pulse flow {[}DON] to mean base flow
   {[}DON] (P:B) was calculated for individual events and averaged
   (geometric) within and then across sites to generate an overall effect
   size. For 47 sites (78 events), mean P:B was 1.58, which was
   significantly different from unity. This moderate increase in DON
   concentration contributed to over a more than 10-fold average increase
   in the rate of DON yield from base flow to high flow. The response of
   {[}DON] to high flow was significant in catchments where individual
   storm events or snowmelt runoff events were responsible for elevated
   flows, whereas the response was not significant in catchments where high
   discharge resulted from a mixture of upstream snowmelt and rain events.
   Additionally, an examination of DOC: DON ratios during high flow
   indicates that multiple sources of DON may be mobilized during high
   flow. Finally, current models of annual DON export may be improved by
   including a positive relationship between discharge and DON.}},

   electrical conductivity data were collected from a gently sloping
   forested swamp complex from July to November 2009. Swamps occupied
   depressions between raised mounds (0.1 to 3 m high) and were connected
   by an ephemeral creek. Runoff was controlled by antecedent moisture
   conditions and influenced by basin microtopography. Two hydrologic
   regimes occurred during the study period and different runoff processes
   dominated each regime. Runoff was generated by subsurface flow during
   dry antecedent conditions as swamps remained hydrologically disconnected
   from each other. Runoff was generated by surface outflow from
   hydrologically connected swamps during wet antecedent conditions as
   ponded water spilled out of the depressions. The forested swamp complex
   produced a faster but limited hydrologic response during dry antecedent
   conditions compared to a slower but greater hydrologic response during
   wet antecedent conditions. Stormwater runoff and runoff ratios were up
   to two orders of magnitude higher in wet conditions than during
   similarly sized events in dry conditions. These factors should be
   considered when designing monitoring programs or runoff models in

Abstract = {{Climate, lithology, soil and especially, intense land use/cover changes,
   make SE Spain very vulnerable to runoff generation and water erosion
   leading to loss of nutrients and organic matter and to infrequent but
   devastating floods, reservoir siltation and mass failures. This
   susceptibility has led to heavy economic investment and research efforts
   since the 1980s, making this region a worldwide reference for
   understanding the hydrology and geomorphology of semiarid ecosystems.
   Runoff and soil erosion have been intensively studied throughout the
   last decades in various natural ecosystems as well as in abandoned
   farmlands. Research has considered a wide range of methods and spatial
   and temporal scales. This paper reviews the methods and data describing
   runoff generation and water erosion, synthesising the key processes
   involved, rates, thresholds and controlling factors from a
   scale-dependent perspective. It also identifies the major gaps in
   current knowledge to provide recommendations for further research
   towards solutions that reduce the negative impacts of erosion. Research
   in SE Spain has contributed significantly to a better understanding of
   the effect of spatial and temporal scale on runoff and sediment yield
   measurements, and highlighted the important role of distinct erosion and
   sediment transport processes, hydrologic connectivity, spatial and
   temporal patterns of rainfall, the occurrence of extreme events and the
   impacts of land use changes. The most effective ways and challenges to
   predict runoff, soil erosion and sediment yield at the catchment scale

Volume = {{47}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the relative influence of catchment structure (topography
   and topology), underlying geology, and vegetation on runoff response is
   key to interpreting catchment hydrology. Hillslope-riparian-stream (HRS)
   water table connectivity serves as the hydrologic linkage between a
   catchment's uplands and the channel network and facilitates the
   transmission of water and solutes to streams. While there has been
   tremendous interest in the concept of hydrological connectivity to
   characterize catchments, few studies have quantified hydrologic
   connectivity at the stream network and catchment scales with
   observational data. Here we examine how catchment topography,
   vegetation, and geology influenced patterns of stream network HRS
   connectivity and runoff dynamics across 11 nested headwater catchments
   in the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest (TCEF), MT. This study
   builds on the empirical findings of Jencso et al. (2009) who found a
   strong linear relationship (r(2) = 0.91) between the upslope accumulated
   area (UAA) and the annual duration of shallow groundwater table
   connectivity observed across 24 HRS transects (146 groundwater recording
   wells). We applied this relationship to the entire stream network across
   11 nested catchments to quantify the frequency distribution of stream
   network connectivity through time, and quantify its relationship to
   catchment-scale runoff dynamics. Each catchment's hydrologic
   connectivity duration curve (CDC) was highly related to its flow
   duration curve (FDC) and the slope of the relationship varied across
   catchments. The slope represents the streamflow yield per unit
   connectivity (Con(yield)). We analyzed the slope of each catchment's
   CDC-FDC relationship or Con(yield) (annual, peak, transition, and base
   flow periods) in multiple linear regression models with common terrain,
   land cover vegetation, and geology explanatory variables. Significant
   predictors (p < 0.05) across 11 catchments included the ratio of flow
   path distances and gradients to the creek (DFC/GTC), geology, and a
   vegetation index. The order and strength of these predictors changed
   seasonally and highlight the hierarchical controls on headwater
   catchment runoff generation. Our results highlight direct and
   quantifiable linkages between catchment topography, vegetation, geology,
   their topology, and hydrologic dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the role of urban spatial development on hydrologic
   response at both catchment (sub-grid) and river basin (between grid)
   scales in central Indiana. At the catchment scale, effective impervious
   area (EIA) was estimated using high density urban area and the patch
   size of low density urban area. The impact of urban spatial arrangement
   on floods was investigated using the estimated EIA for the entire White
   River basin, Indiana, as input to the Variable Infiltration Capacity
   (VIC) hydrology model with urban representation. A geographic
   information systems (GIS)-based routing scheme was introduced to the VIC
   model to route the total runoff. Seven theoretical scenarios were
   developed with equal urban area distributed in different isochrone
   zones. For return periods up to and including 100-year, the flood peaks
   at the basin outlet are largest if the travel time from urban cells is
   approximate to the mode of all pixels' travel time (plus the time for
   runoff rate to reach its maximum in a storm event) of the basin. Flood
   peaks tend to be smaller and arrive earlier with urbanization if
   development occurs in areas with shorter travel time, so the largest
   impacts of urbanization are not necessarily seen immediately downstream
   of the development. This research demonstrated that the spatial pattern
   of urban development can affect the hydrologic regime by influencing the
   hydrologic connectivity of urban area at a catchment scale, while at the
   river basin scale it is the travel time of urban location that controls

Abstract = {{We investigated functional and structural responses of periphyton
   communities to simulated nonpoint source (NPS) pollution over a 2-year
   period. Periphyton communities were examined in three unique but
   hydrologically connected habitats in the lower Muskegon River: river,
   wetland, and lake. Our study addressed several major questions: (1) what
   are the effects of nonpoint source pollutants on periphyton structure
   and function, (2) to what degree do environmental conditions, including
   the pollutant delivery system and hydrologic conditions, affect
   periphyton response, and (3) do periphyton communities show synchronous
   responses to nonpoint source pollution? Nutrients were added over a
   21-day period in each of the four seasons over 2 years. The effect of
   road salt on metabolism was evaluated in the winter and spring seasons
   in the river habitat only. In general, the periphyton community showed
   complex responses to the NPS amendments, but there was little evidence
   of nutrient limitation in this system based on community structure,
   biomass accrual, metabolism, or alkaline phosphatase activity. This
   result was unexpected given the relatively low ambient concentrations of
   phosphorus. We discuss the possibilities that nutrient delivery was
   ineffective or that herbivory and/or irradiance might have constrained
   periphyton growth, but ultimately conclude that our results suggest that
   periphyton communities in the lower Muskegon River watershed were (1)
   nutrient-replete, (2) tolerant of short-term salt additions, and (3)
   influenced more by local conditions (habitat) than by regional
   (watershed) factors. In systems where nonpoint source pollutant delivery
   is diffuse and hydrologic residence time is short, the influence of
   nonpoint source pollutants on periphyton may be either modest or too
   difficult to detect using traditional endpoints.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary production is a composite measure of an animal population's

   converts animal abundance and biomass data into a functional measure of
   energy flow through an ecosystem. In the present study, we used
   community secondary production as a composite measure of ecosystem
   functional response to anthropogenic disturbance, and applied this
   approach to examine effects of fragmentation on tidal creek ecosystems
   in The Bahamas. Community fish production decreased from a mean of 901 g
   m(-2) yr(-1) in unfragmented creeks to 166 g m(-2) yr(-1) in downstream
   areas of fragmented creeks to 29 g m(-2) yr(-1) upstream of creek
   blockages in fragmented creeks. When compared with several univariate
   measures (species richness, evenness, abundance, biomass), community
   composition (by ordination), and community distribution (via rank-curve
   analysis), community secondary production appeared to be the most
   consistent variable for distinguishing between three creek fragmentation
   categories. These data suggest that small, non-significant declines in
   diversity or other structural metrics can yield disproportionately large
   declines in ecosystem function. We suggest community secondary
   production can be an important component of future assessments of
   anthropogenic impacts, especially when alterations in diversity or
   community structure are small, but potentially have dramatic impacts on

Abstract = {{A drainage basin's runoff response can be determined by the connectivity
   of generated runoff to the stream network and the connectivity of the
   downstream drainage network. The connectivity of a drainage basin
   modulates its ability to produce streamflow and respond to precipitation
   events and is a function of the complex and variable storage capacities
   throughout the drainage basin and along the drainage network. An
   improved means to measure and account for the dynamics of stream network
   connectivity at the catchment scale is needed to predict basin scale
   streamflow. At a 150 km(2) subarctic Precambrian Shield catchment where
   the poorly drained heterogeneous mosaic of lakes, exposed bedrock, and
   soil filled areas creates variable contributing areas, hydrological
   connectivity was measured in 11 sub-basins with a particular focus on
   three representative sub-basins. The three sub-basins, although of
   similar relative size, vary considerably in the dominant typology and
   topology of their constituent elements. At a 10-m spatial resolution,
   saturated areas were mapped using both multispectral satellite imagery
   and onsite measurements of storage according to land cover. To measure
   basin-scale hydrological connectivity, the drainage network was
   represented using graph theory where stream reaches are `edges'
   connecting sub-basin `nodes'. The overall hydrological connectivity of
   the stream network was described as the ratio of actively flowing
   relative to potentially flowing stream reaches. The hydrological
   connectivity of the stream network to the outlet was described as the
   ratio of actively flowing stream reaches that were connected to the
   outlet to the potentially flowing stream reaches. Hydrological
   connectivity was then related to daily average streamflow and basin
   runoff ratio. Improved understanding of causal factors for the variable
   streamflow response to runoff generation in this environment will serve
   as a first step towards improved streamflow prediction in formerly
   glaciated landscapes, especially in small ungauged basins. Copyright (C)

   0.52 mu g/L) consisted of MC-LR (76\%), MC-RR (14\%), MC-YR (6\%), and
   MC-LA (3\%). The lakes were dominated by the cyanobacteria Microcystis

   Lake discharge appears to be the source of C raciborskii, the
   physical/chemical properties of Muskegon Lake (lower turbidity and
   temperature, higher nitrate) may constrain the growth of this invasive
   species. Thus, local conditions in each lake are important in
   determining which species are capable of maintaining a viable

Abstract = {{The hyporheic zone is of great interest for stream ecologists because of
   its role in stream biogeochemical processing. Our study addresses the
   effects of leaf-litter inputs and varying discharge on surface-hyporheic
   water exchange and their possible consequences for the hyporheic zone
   biogeochemistry. Our study was conducted during autumn in Riera de Santa
   Fe (northeastern Iberian Peninsula), a stream with a well developed
   deciduous riparian canopy. We placed 15 wells spaced at 5-m intervals
   longitudinally down the study reach and measured surface and hyporheic
   nutrient and dissolved O-2 (DO) concentrations on 23 sampling dates (15
   during the leaffall period and 8 after a flood that washed out 65\% of
   the accumulated leaf biomass). We assessed changes in surface-water
   exchange and in hyporheic NH4-N and soluble reactive P (SRP) uptake via
   coinjection of a conservative tracer and nutrients. Compared to surface
   water, hyporheic water had lower DO, higher SRP and NO3-N
   concentrations, and similar NH4-N concentration. Hyporheic water had
   higher DO saturation (p = 0.00) and higher NH4-N concentration (p =
   0.00) in downwelling than in upwelling wells, whereas SRP and NO3-N
   concentrations did not differ significantly between well types (p >
   0.05). Hydrologic connectivity was higher in downwelling than in
   upwelling wells and decreased with leaf-litter accumulation in the
   stream channel and increased with stream discharge. Increased
   connectivity after a flood reduced the difference in DO between surface
   and hyporheic compartments in upwelling and downwelling wells and in
   NO3-N in upwelling wells. NH4-N and SRP uptake responded differently to
   these changes. Hyporheic SRP uptake rate was controlled by hyporheic SRP
   concentration, which did not vary with changes in connectivity, whereas
   NH4-N uptake rate was indirectly affected by changes in connectivity
   through the influence of connectivity on DO availability. Last, although
   no NO3-N was added during the solute injections, we observed an increase
   in hyporheic NO3-N that probably was caused by nitrification. Together
   these results illustrate how the combination of stream hydrology and
   organic matter accumulation can dictate seasonal changes in hyporheic
   biogeochemistry.}},

Abstract = {{Disconnection between adjacent habitat patches is one of the most
   notable factors contributing to the decreased biotic integrity of global
   ecosystems. Connectivity is especially threatened in river-floodplain
   ecosystems in which channel modifications have disrupted the lateral
   links between the main river channel and floodplain lakes. In this
   study, we examined the interaction between the interconnectedness of
   floodplain lakes and main river channels and fish assemblage
   descriptors. Fish assemblages in two segments of an oxbow lake, one
   connected to and the other isolated from the Yazoo River, Mississippi,
   were estimated with daytime boat electrofishing during 2007-2010. The
   frequency of connection for the connected segment ranged from zero to
   seven individual events per year (mean, similar to 2). The timing of
   most connection events reflected regional precipitation patterns.
   Greater species richness, diversity, and evenness were observed in the
   connected segment. Additionally, the connected segment had a greater
   abundance of piscivores and periodic life history strategists. All
   fishes collected solely in the connected segment were typically riverine
   in nature, whereas fishes collected only in the disconnected segment
   were more lacustrine adapted. These results suggest that periodic
   connection and the associated habitat heterogeneity that it provides are
   important for maintaining fish species richness and diversity in
   large-river floodplain lakes. We suggest that maintenance or restoration
   of connection be an integral part of fluvial ecosystem management plans.}},

Abstract = {{Impoundment of rivers by dams is widespread and one of the most
   devastating anthropogenic impacts to freshwater environments. Linking
   theoretical and applied research on river impoundment requires an
   improved capacity for predicting how varying degrees of impoundment
   affects a range of species. Here, growth of 14 North American sunfish
   species resilient to river impoundment was compared in rivers versus
   impoundments. Growth response to river impoundment varied widely, but
   consistently among taxa: five species (shadow bass, rock bass, flier,
   redbreast sunfish and green sunfish) showed significantly higher growth
   in riverine ecosystems, four species (largemouth bass, smallmouth bass,
   spotted bass and longear sunfish) showed significantly higher growth in
   impounded ecosystems, and five species (bluegill, black crappie, white
   crappie, redear sunfish and warmouth) displayed no difference in growth
   between rivers and impoundments. Furthermore, significant linear models
   were developed for predicting growth of two species (largemouth bass,
   R-2 = 0.75 and warmouth, R-2 = 0.44) based on a physiographically
   specific index of reservoir retention time. For another species (white
   crappie), growth could not be predicted by the retention time index in
   Central Lowlands rivers (R-2 = 0.001), but was strongly predicted by
   this factor in southeastern Coastal Plain rivers (R-2 = 0.76) showing
   how impacts of impoundment, and prediction of its consequences, can vary
   across river landscape types. Further analysis of fish growth in
   response to river impoundment, regulation and fragmentation could
   greatly enhance conservation biology, restoration ecology and basic land

Abstract = {{Sedimentary plains with extremely flat topography, such as the Pampas in
   Argentina, often display flooding drought cycles. Changes in water table
   depth and surface water coverage affect natural and cultivated
   vegetation, wildlife, and people. Here, we describe groundwater dynamics
   and water-body expansion in a 10-year flooding cycle in the valuable
   agricultural lands of Western Pampas. We analysed water-table depth,
   surface water coverage, and rainfall from 1996 to 2005 covering similar
   to 28 000 km(2). We characterized the dynamics of water storage based on
   groundwater observations and remote sensing estimates of the coverage
   (LANDSAT) and elevation (ENVISAT) of water bodies as well as water
   storage anomalies captured by the gravity recovery and climate
   experiment (GRACE). Surface water coverage fluctuated from 3 to 28\% and
   groundwater levels displayed a similar to 2.5 m change. Regional water
   storage raised by similar to 800 mm with 63\% of this water accretion
   accounted by groundwater. Ground and surface water dynamics were closely
   coupled but this link differed between lowlands and highlands and
   depending on whether the system was at the gaining or retraction stage.
   This asymmetrical behaviour was likely caused by shifts in regional
   connectivity. Regional surface + groundwater storage compared well with
   water storage anomalies obtained from GRACE, suggesting that this tool
   may represent a methodological shortcut to estimate water storage
   changes. The tight connection between ground and surface water, and the
   relatively slow process of cumulative water accretion and coalescence of
   water bodies that precedes flood events offer the opportunity of
   developing warning systems that could help land managers to adapt to
   climate changes. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Disruption of hydrologic connectivity via road crossings is extremely
   common in Bahamian tidal creeks, resulting in increased sedimentation
   and decreased habitat quality and quantity for biota. We restored
   hydrologic connectivity (i.e., tidal flow) in two small Bahamian
   mangrove tidal creeks in May 2004 and 2005. We observed the
   characteristics of fish assemblage structure (species richness) and
   function (secondary production and transient species utilization of

   with fragmented and unfragmented reference creeks. Restoration
   significantly increased species richness and secondary production of

   utilization of the previously blocked wetlands by transient fishes was
   observed in both creeks. We suggest success could be attributed to the
   presence of adjacent nearshore recruitment sources, a more complex local
   seascape (i.e., high habitat heterogeneity in the creek and local
   nearshore), and the creation of deep upstream refugia pools. This is one
   of the first studies to use both structural and functional

Abstract = {{We investigated the aquatic and riparian herpetofauna in a 789 km2 river
   catchment in northwest California to examine competing theories of
   biotic community structuring in catchment stream networks. Research in
   fluvial geomorphology has resulted in multi-scale models of dynamic
   processes that cyclically create, maintain, and destroy environments in
   stream networks of mountain catchments. These models have been applied
   to understanding distributions of invertebrates, algae, fishes and their
   habitats across entire basin networks, but similar approaches with
   herpetofauna are rare. We examined multi-scale spatial patterns of
   multiple species as they related to variation in channel types, channel
   settings, and within-channel attributes that result from these
   processes. From 83 reaches distributed randomly throughout the
   watershed, we distinguished four channel types: 1) high gradient with
   cascade structure; 2) 2-4\% gradient with step-pool structure controlled
   by moderately steep valleys; 3) slightly entrenched, lower gradient,
   plane-bed structure; and 4) low gradient, shallow, unconfined, multiple
   or migrating pool/riffle channels in broad alluvial valleys. The
   composition of herpetofauna differed in five of six pair-wise
   comparisons among these channel types, indicating a minimum of three
   distinct mesoscale assemblages. We used non-parametric multiple
   regression (NPMR) to examine relationships at multiple spatial scales.
   NPMR revealed species-specific associations with channel settings and
   within-channel environments among species sharing the same sets of
   channel types. Morphological adaptations, biophysical limits and natural
   histories of each species best explained their associations with
   distinct sets of attributes surrounding and within channel types. While
   each set of species has similarly adapted to fluvial and geomorphic
   disturbance processes structuring channels at the mesoscale, species
   within each set have adapted to a unique set of attributes that are best
   discerned when their spatial relationships are examined across multiple
   spatial scales. We evaluated the various spatial patterns against
   hypotheses of stream community organization and metacommunity
   perspectives.}},

Abstract = {{P>1. The progression of approaches in systematic conservation planning
   from representation to representation and persistence has greatly
   enhanced its potential applicability to freshwaters. However, conceptual
   frameworks that consolidate principles for incorporating persistence
   into freshwater conservation planning are still lacking.
   2. We present four key principles to consider when planning for the
   persistence of freshwater biodiversity: selecting ecosystems of high
   ecological integrity; incorporating connectivity; incorporating areas
   important to population persistence; and identifying additional natural
   processes that can be mapped.
   3. The practicalities of gathering data and conducting the conservation
   plan to address these principles are explored here using a case study in
   the Olifants/Doorn Water Management Area, South Africa. Spatial layers
   are developed for depicting ecological integrity, sub-catchment
   boundaries, riparian zones and wetlands, high water-yield areas and
   patterns of groundwater discharge and recharge.
   4. These data are used to develop a conservation area network that
   supports both representation and persistence of freshwater biodiversity.
   Although the planning region is relatively data rich by global
   standards, several data deficiencies were identified. We suggest ways of
   using environmental surrogates to address data deficiencies, improving
   confidence in these surrogates by combining them wherever possible with
   existing field data and expert knowledge.
   5. We also recommend methods to achieve spatial efficiency by
   simultaneously designing for representation and persistence of
   freshwater biodiversity. Spatial efficiency can be achieved in different
   ways when using a conservation planning algorithm and a multiple-use
   zoning strategy.
   6. The allocation of multiple-use zones aligns closely with the
   objectives of integrated water resources management and land use
   planning. Given the practicalities at local levels of planning, we
   recommend using multiple-use zones in the design phase, rather than
   merely at the end once the design is complete.}},

Pages = {{689-702}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates the role of soil moisture on the threshold
   runoff response in a small headwater catchment in the Italian Alps that
   is characterised by steep hillslopes and a distinct riparian zone. This
   study focuses on: (i) the threshold soil moisture-runoff relationship
   and the influence of catchment topography on this relation; (ii) the
   temporal dynamics of soil moisture, streamflow and groundwater that
   characterize the catchment's response to rainfall during dry and wet
   periods; and (iii) the combined effect of antecedent wetness conditions
   and rainfall amount on hillslope and riparian runoff. Our results
   highlight the strong control exerted by soil moisture on runoff in this
   catchment: a sharp threshold exists in the relationship between soil
   water content and runoff coefficient, streamflow, and hillslope-averaged
   depth to water table. Low runoff ratios were likely related to the
   response of the riparian zone, which was almost always close to
   saturation. High runoff ratios occurred during wet antecedent
   conditions, when the soil moisture threshold was exceeded. In these
   cases, subsurface flow was activated on hillslopes, which became a major
   contributor to runoff. Antecedent wetness conditions also controlled the
   catchment's response time: during dry periods, streamflow reacted and
   peaked prior to hillslope soil moisture whereas during wet conditions
   the opposite occurred. This difference resulted in a hysteretic
   behaviour in the soil moisture-streamflow relationship. Finally, the
   influence of antecedent moisture conditions on runoff was also evident
   in the relation between cumulative rainfall and total stormflow. Small
   storms during dry conditions produced low stormflow amounts, likely
   mainly from overland flow from the near saturated riparian zone.
   Conversely, for rainfall events during wet conditions, higher stormflow
   values were observed and hillslopes must have contributed to streamflow.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between rainfall and runoff in catchments is a
   nonlinear function largely controlled by hydrologically connected

   geometrical hillslope properties determining connection of hillslope
   elements to form subsurface drainage pathways in an artificial catchment
   (Chicken Creek) and we examine the impact of the drainage pathway
   connectivity on the catchment runoff. We developed a three-dimensional
   model based on percolation theory to simulate the drainage pathways in
   the catchment and to quantify the contribution from subsurface flow
   paths to total catchment outflow. The simulations show that the degree
   of drainage pathway connectivity depends on small-scale variability of
   soil depth, soil hydraulic properties and topography. Additionally,
   connectivity was very sensitive to changes of soil water content in the
   catchment with dramatic change of subsurface flow for small changes in
   soil water content. This threshold-like behaviour of flow paths
   connectivity accounted for the sudden availability of a large amount of
   drainable water, postulating a nonlinear rainfall-runoff relationship as
   confirmed by first observations in the Chicken Creek catchment. The
   model reproduced subsurface flow patterns, which were indicated by soil
   moisture measurements and visual observations in the catchment. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Mediterranean streams are characterized by water flow changes caused by
   floods and droughts. When intermittency occurs in river ecosystems,
   hydrologic connectivity is interrupted and this affects benthic,
   hyporheic and flowing water compartments. Organic matter use and
   transport can be particularly affected during the transition from wet to
   dry and dry to wet conditions. In order to characterize the changes in
   benthic organic matter quantity and quality throughout a drying and
   rewetting process, organic matter, and enzyme activities were analyzed
   in the benthic accumulated material (biofilms growing on rocks and
   cobbles, leaves, and sand) and in flowing water (dissolved and
   particulate fractions). The total polysaccharide, amino acid, and lipid
   content in the benthic organic matter were on average higher in the
   drying period than in the rewetting period. However, during the drying
   period, peptide availability decreased, as indicated by decreases in
   leucine aminopeptidase activity, as well as amino acid content in the
   water and benthic material, except leaves; while polysaccharides were
   actively used, as indicated by an increase in beta-glucosidase activity
   in the benthic substrata and an increase in polysaccharide content of
   the particulate water fraction and in leaf material. During this
   process, microbial heterotrophs were constrained to use the organic
   matter source of the lowest quality (polysaccharides, providing only C),
   since peptides (providing N and C) were no longer available. During the
   flow recovery phase, the microbial community rapidly recovered,
   suggesting the use of refuges and/or adaptation to desiccation during
   the previous drought period. The scouring during rewetting was
   responsible for the mobilization of the streambed and loss of benthic
   material, and the increase in high quality organic matter in transport
   (at that moment, polysaccharides and amino acids accounted for 30\% of
   the total DOC). The dynamics of progressive and gradual drought effects,
   as well as the fast recovery after rewetting, might be affected by the
   interaction of the individual dynamics of each benthic substratum: sand
   sediments and leaves providing refuge for microorganisms and organic
   matter storage, while on cobbles, an active bacterial community is
   developed in the rewetting. Since global climate change may favor a
   higher intensity and frequency of droughts in streams, understanding the
   effects of these disturbances on the materials and biota could
   contribute to reliable resource management. The maintenance of benthic
   substrata heterogeneity within the stream may be important for stream
   recovery after droughts.}},

Abstract = {{P>1. In this review, we first summarize how hydrologic connectivity has
   been studied for riverine fish capable of moving long distances, and
   then identify research opportunities that have clear conservation
   significance. Migratory species, such as anadromous salmonids, are good
   model organisms for understanding ecological connectivity in rivers
   because the spatial scale over which movements occur among freshwater
   habitats is large enough to be easily observed with available
   techniques; they are often economically or culturally valuable with
   habitats that can be easily fragmented by human activities; and they
   integrate landscape conditions from multiple surrounding catchment(s)
   with in-river conditions. Studies have focussed on three themes: (i)
   relatively stable connections (connections controlled by processes that
   act over broad spatio-temporal scales > 1000 km2 and > 100 years); (ii)
   dynamic connections (connections controlled by processes acting over
   fine to moderate spatio-temporal scales similar to 1-1000 km2 and <
   1-100 years); and (iii) anthropogenic influences on hydrologic
   connectivity, including actions that disrupt or enhance natural
   connections experienced by fish.
   2. We outline eight challenges to understanding the role of connectivity
   in riverine fish ecology, organized under three foci: (i) addressing the
   constraints of river structure; (ii) embracing temporal complexity in
   hydrologic connectivity; and (iii) managing connectivity for riverine
   fishes. Challenges include the spatial structure of stream networks, the
   force and direction of flow, scale-dependence of connectivity, shifting
   boundaries, complexity of behaviour and life histories and quantifying
   anthropogenic influence on connectivity and aligning management goals.
   As we discuss each challenge, we summarize relevant approaches in the
   literature and provide additional suggestions for improving research and
   management of connectivity for riverine fishes.
   3. Specifically, we suggest that rapid advances are possible in the
   following arenas: (i) incorporating network structure and river
   discharge into analyses; (ii) increasing explicit consideration of
   temporal complexity and fish behaviour in the scope of analyses; and
   (iii) parsing degrees of human and natural influences on connectivity
   and defining acceptable alterations. Multiscale analyses are most likely
   to identify dominant patterns of connections and disconnections, and the
   appropriate scale at which to focus conservation activities.}},

Abstract = {{This study compared the hydrology, physiochemistry, and amphibian
   biomass between a complex of created vernal pools and a complex of
   natural vernal pools in 2007 in central Ohio, United States. Hydrologic
   connectivity of surface water and groundwater differed between the
   natural and the created pool complexes. Surface inundation duration for
   created pools exceeded that of natural pools, although spring water
   depths were similar. Dissolved oxygen (p = 0.05) and hourly temperature
   (p = 0.00) were 1.2\% and 1.1\% higher, respectively, in the created
   pools, and conductivity was 1.5\% higher (p = 0.00) in the natural
   pools. Amphibian dip net results found no significant difference in
   biomass between natural and created pools or family (hylid, ranid, and
   ambystomatid) biomass in both pool types. Amphibian families were evenly
   represented by both capture methods in the created wetlands; however,
   the distribution of families was not even in natural pools and the
   proportion of ranids was four times greater for samples obtained by
   funnel traps than dip netting. Eleven years after construction, the
   created vernal pools did not mimic natural pools in surface inundation
   and groundwater-surface water exchange, dissolved oxygen, and water
   temperature. The created pools are perched wetlands and are never likely
   to mimic reference pool hydrology. Dissolved oxygen and temperature
   differences are likely due to the separation of surface water and
   groundwater in the created pools. However, the created pools exhibited a
   higher taxa diversity than the natural pools due to a more even
   distribution of organisms between the three families.}},

Abstract = {{Streamflow sources across various hydrologic conditions were examined in
   a 5.1 ha temperate humid forested catchment (Laurentians, Canada). In
   that system, the relationship between rainfall and runoff is nonlinear,
   thus hinting towards complex processes involving critical, transient
   source areas and a changing catchment internal state of connectivity.
   Multiyear daily stream chemistry data were broken down into several
   hydrologic scenarios reflecting different conditions with respect to
   stream discharge and antecedent catchment wetness. End-member mixing
   analysis and mass balance calculations were performed to: (I) compare
   the dimensionality of the mixing spaces (i.e. the number of streamflow
   sources) obtained under 64 different hydrologic scenarios; (2) screen
   independently sampled end-members (i.e. the nature of sources) to assess
   catchment connectivity from a spatial perspective; and (3) estimate the
   relative contributions of end-members to streamflow to characterize
   hydrological connectivity from a volumetric standpoint. Mixing space
   dimensionality did not vary significantly among the tested hydrologic
   scenarios, as three end-members were generally required to account for
   most of the variance in stream geochemistry. Differences were
   significant in the ability of the tested end-members to fit in mixing
   spaces; for instance, throughfall and organic soil water end-members
   better fitted in mixing spaces associated with high rather than low
   discharges. The relative contributions of end-members to streamflow were
   highly variable in time. Scenarios involving low discharges and dry
   antecedent conditions were mostly associated with baseflow, while
   scenarios involving high discharges and wet antecedent conditions were
   associated with increased proportions of throughfall and organic soil
   water from downstream downslope and downstream upslope areas. These
   results suggest a cautious evaluation of the predictive power of one
   single mixing space with regards to the nature of streamflow sources
   across hydrologic conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   turnover: Implications of catchment structure for riparian buffering and
   stream water sources}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Hydrologic connectivity between catchment upland and near stream areas
   is essential for the transmission of water, solutes, and nutrients to
   streams. However, our current understanding of the role of riparian
   zones in mediating landscape hydrologic connectivity and the catchment
   scale export of water and solutes is limited. We tested the relationship
   between the duration of hillslope-riparian-stream (HRS) hydrologic
   connectivity and the rate and degree of riparian shallow groundwater
   turnover along four HRS well transects within a set of nested mountain
   catchments (Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest, MT). Transect HRS
   water table connectivity ranged from 9 to 123 days during the annual
   snowmelt hydrograph. Hillslope water was always characterized by low
   specific conductance (similar to 27 mu S cm(-1)). In transects with
   transient hillslope water tables, riparian groundwater specific
   conductance was elevated during base flow conditions (similar to 127 mu
   S cm(-1)) but shifted toward hillslope signatures once a HRS groundwater
   connection was established. The degree of riparian groundwater turnover
   was proportional to the duration of HRS connectivity and inversely
   related to the riparian: hillslope area ratios (buffer ratio; r(2) =
   0.95). We applied this relationship to the stream network in seven
   subcatchments within the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest and
   compared their turnover distributions to source water contributions
   measured at each catchment outlet. The amount of riparian groundwater
   exiting each of the seven catchments was linearly related (r(2) = 0.92)
   to their median riparian turnover time. Our observations suggest that
   the size and spatial arrangement of hillslope and riparian zones along a
   stream network and the timing and duration of groundwater connectivity
   between them is a first-order control on the magnitude and timing of
   water and solutes observed at the catchment outlet.}},

Abstract = {{delta(13)C was used to identify seasonal variations in the importance of
   autochthonous and allochthonous sources of productivity for fish
   communities in intermittently connected estuarine areas of Australia's
   dry tropics. A total of 224 fish from 38 species were collected from six
   intermittently connected estuarine pools, three in central Queensland
   (two dominated by C(3) forest and one by C(4) pasture) and three in
   north Queensland (one dominated by C(3) and two by C(4) vegetation).
   Samples were collected before and after the wet season. Fish collected
   in the two forested areas in central Queensland had the lowest
   delta(13)C, suggesting a greater incorporation of C(3) terrestrial
   material. A seasonal variation in delta(13)C was also detected for these
   areas, with mean delta(13)C varying from -20 to -23aEuro degrees from
   the pre- to the post-wet season, indicating a greater incorporation of
   terrestrial carbon after the wet season. Negative seasonal shifts in
   fish delta(13)C were also present at the pasture site, suggesting a
   greater dependence on carbon of riparian vegetation (C(3) Juncus sp.) in
   the post-wet season. In north Queensland, terrestrial carbon seemed to
   be incorporated by fish in the two C(4) areas, as delta(13)C of most
   species shifted towards slightly heavier values in the post-wet season.
   A two-source, one-isotope mixing model also indicated a greater
   incorporation of carbon of terrestrial origin in the post-wet season.
   However, no seasonal differences in delta(13)C were detected for fish
   from the forested area of north Queensland. Overall, hydrologic
   connectivity seemed to be a key factor in regulating the ultimate
   sources of carbon in these areas. It is therefore important to preserve
   the surrounding habitats and to maintain the hydrologic regimes as close

Abstract = {{Hydrologic connectivity is regarded as one of the key controls in
   determining catchment rainfall-run-off response and has been linked to
   the export of solutes from uplands to streams. We sought to identify the
   patterns of hydrologic connectivity within a small forested watershed by
   monitoring the shallow groundwater fluctuations of simple
   topographically defined landform sequences
   (footslope-backslope-shoulder). A spatially distributed instrument
   network was employed to continuously measure hydrometric responses of
   the shallow subsurface during seasonal wet-up from summer through winter
   in a small till mantled research catchment. We demonstrate that the
   spatial patterns of shallow water table extent and duration, and
   therefore hydrologic connectivity, had a strong seasonal signature.
   During the low antecedent soil moisture conditions typically associated
   with the growing season, water tables were patchy, discontinuous, and
   only the wettest near-stream footslope areas were consistently
   hydrologically connected with the stream network. During the dormant
   season, footslopes and backslopes maintained water tables that persisted
   between storm events and were almost continuously connected with the
   stream network. In the largest storm events, the typically driest
   landforms (shoulder slopes) established shallow transient water tables,
   suggesting that nearly the entire catchment was temporarily
   hydrologically connected with the stream network. In addition, we found
   significant differences (p < 0.05) in the magnitude and duration of
   groundwater responses to rainfall among landform groups both seasonally
   and during events. These results have implications for using a
   similarity approach in representing characteristic hydrologic responses
   of topographically defined watershed elements, determining hydrologic
   connectivity between watershed elements, as well as for understanding

Abstract = {{Stream DOC dynamics during snowmelt have been the focus of much
   research, and numerous DOC mobilization and delivery mechanisms from
   riparian and upland areas have been proposed. However, landscape
   structure controls on DOC export from riparian and upland landscape
   elements remains poorly understood. We investigated stream and
   groundwater DOC dynamics across three transects and seven adjacent but
   diverse catchments with a range of landscape characteristics during
   snowmelt (April 15-July 15) in the northern Rocky Mountains, Montana. We
   observed a range of DOC export dynamics across riparian and upland
   landscape settings and varying degrees of hydrologic connectivity
   between the stream, riparian, and upland zones. DOC export from riparian
   zones required a hydrologic connection across the riparian-stream
   interface, and occurred at landscape positions with a wide range of
   upslope accumulated area (UAA) and wetness status. In contrast,
   mobilization of DOC from the uplands appeared restricted to areas with a
   hydrologic connection across the entire upland-riparian-stream
   continuum, which generally occurred only at areas with high UAA, and/or
   at times of high wetness. Further, the relative extent of DOC-rich
   riparian and wetland zones strongly influenced catchment DOC export.
   Cumulative stream DOC export was highest from catchments with a large
   proportion of riparian to upland area, and ranged from 6.3 to 12.4 kg
   ha(-1) across the study period. This research suggests that the
   spatial/temporal intersection of hydrologic connectivity and DOC source

   spatial scale to encompass dynamic processes and for floodplain benefits

   weighted risk factors perceived important to the emergence and spread of
   the viral genotype, VHSV IVb, within and from the Great Lakes region of
   the US and Canada. Identified factors included the presence of known
   VHSV-susceptible species, water temperatures conducive for disease,

   untested shipments of live or frozen fish from known positive regions,
   insufficient regulatory infrastructure for fish health oversight, and
   uncontrolled exposure to fomites associated with boat and equipment or

Abstract = {{Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were used to measure the
   levels of genetic variation and patterns of the population structure
   within and among the five remaining populations of Ceratopteris
   pteridoides, an endangered aquatic fern in China. Fourteen RAPD primers
   amplified 101 reproducible bands, with 34 (33.66\%) of them being
   polymorphic, indicating low levels of genetic diversity at the species
   level. The level of genetic diversity within the populations was
   considerably lower, with the percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB)
   ranging from 16.83\% to 24.75\%. AMOVA analysis revealed a low level of
   genetic variation (30.92\%) among the populations. The UPGMA cluster of
   72 samples detected that individuals from the same population did not
   form one distinct group, indicating high levels of gene flow between the
   populations. A Mantel test showed no significant relationship between
   genetic distance and geographic distance (r = 0.2166). Our results were
   similar to those obtained in an earlier ISSR analysis. Thus both RAPD
   and ISSR markers have comparable sensitivity, and could be employed to
   assess the partition of genetic diversity within and among populations.
   Several factors including clonal growth, inbreeding, high spore
   dispersal and the extensive hydrologic connectivity among populations
   which facilitate long-distance gene flow, might have played an important
   role in maintaining the genetic structure of the populations. In view of
   the genetic information currently available, we recommend establishing
   as many in situ conservation spots as possible and the cross
   transplanting of plants between populations in order to increase gene
   flow and preserve the genetic resources of the species.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial heterogeneity influences ecosystem structure and function across
   multiple habitat scales. Although primary production and respiration are
   fundamental to energy cycling in aquatic ecosystems, we know relatively
   little about how habitat scale influences metabolism. In this study, we
   adopted a multi-scale habitat approach to evaluate primary production
   and respiration in a coastal Great Lakes watershed that is experiencing
   pressure from past, present, and anticipated future human activities. We
   divided the watershed into five macrohabitats (stream, river, wetland,
   drowned-river mouth lake, and Great Lake), two mesohabitats (benthic and
   water column), and four microhabitats (periphytic substrates:
   sand/sediment, rock, wood, and plant) for evaluation of spatial patterns
   and synchrony in metabolism. Factors that influenced patterns of
   metabolism were scale dependent. Algal biomass strongly influenced
   spatial patterns in metabolism at the meso- and microhabitat scales;
   greater algal biomass translated to higher areal-specific and lower
   chlorophyll-specific metabolism at benthic mesohabitat and sand/sediment
   and rock microhabitats. Benthic metabolism overwhelmed water column
   metabolism, irrespective of location or time of year. Watershed position
   was important at the macrohabitat scale, with greater overall metabolism
   in macrohabitats located lower in the watershed. Average synchrony in
   metabolism rates was greatest at the macrohabitat scale, suggesting
   metabolic patterns that are evident at finer scales may become
   integrated at coarser scales. Our results (1) show that spatial and
   temporal patterns in metabolism are shaped by factors that are dependent
   upon habitat scale; (2) highlight the importance of benthic productivity
   across habitat and season; and (3) suggest that hydrologic connectivity
   strongly influences ecosystem processes, although physical factors can
   affect these responses as evidenced by the low levels of synchrony
   between Lake Michigan and the other macrohabitats.}},

Abstract = {{This study delineated spatially and temporally variable runoff
   generation areas in the Sand Mountain region pasture of North Alabama
   under natural rainfall conditions, and demonstrated that hydrologic
   connectivity is important for generating hillslope response when
   infiltration-excess (IE) runoff mechanism dominates. Data from six
   rainfall events (13.7-32.3 mm) on an intensively instrumented pasture
   hillslope (0.12 ha) were analysed. Analysis of data from surface runoff
   sensors, tipping bucket rain gauge and HS-flume demonstrated spatial and
   temporal variability in runoff generation areas. Results showed that the
   maximum runoff generation area, which contributed to runoff at the
   outlet of the hillslope, varied between 67 and 100\%. Furthermore,
   because IE was the main runoff generation mechanism on the hillslope,
   the data showed that as the rainfall intensity changed during a rainfall
   event, the runoff generation areas expanded or contracted. During
   rainfall events with high-intensity short-to medium-duration, 4-8\% of
   total rainfall was converted to runoff at the outlet. Rainfall events
   with medium-to low-intensity, medium-duration were found less likely to
   generate runoff at the outlet. In situ soil hydraulic conductivity (k)
   was measured across the hillslope, which confirmed its effect on
   hydrologic connectivity of runoff generation areas. Combined surface
   runoff sensor and k-interpolated data clearly showed that during a
   rainfall event, lower k areas generate runoff first, and then, depending
   on rainfall intensity, runoff at the outlet is generated by
   hydrologically connected areas. It was concluded that in
   IE-runoff-dominated areas, rainfall intensity and k can explain
   hydrologic response. The study demonstrated that only connected areas of
   low k values generate surface runoff during high-intensity rainfall
   events. Identification of these areas would serve as an important
   foundation for controlling nonpoint source pollutant transport,
   especially phosphorus. The best management practices can be developed
   and implemented to reduce transport of phosphorus from these
   hydrologically connected areas. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Faunal assemblages and multi scale habitat patterns in headwater
   tributaries of the South Fork Trinity River an unregulated river
   embedded within a multiple use landscape. Headwaters can represent 80\%
   of stream kilometers in a watershed, and they also have unique physical
   and biological properties that have only recently been recognized for
   their importance in sustaining healthy functioning stream networks and
   their ecological services. We sampled 60 headwater tributaries in the
   South Fork Trinity River, a 2,430 km(2), mostly forested, multiple use
   watershed in northwestern California. Our objectives were: (1) to
   differentiate unique headwater types using 69 abiotic and vegetation
   variables measured at three spatial scales, and then to reduce these to
   informative subsets; (2) determine if distinct biota occupied the
   different tributary types; (3) determine the environmental attributes
   associated with the presence and abundance of these biotic assemblages;
   and (4) using niche modeling, determine key attribute thresholds to
   illustrate how these biota could be employed as metrics of system
   integrity and ecological services. Several taxa were sufficiently
   abundant and widespread to use as bio-indicators: the presence and
   abundance of steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), herpetofauna
   (reptile and amphibian) species richness, and signal crayfish
   (Pacifastacus leniusculus) represented different trophic positions,
   value as commercial resources (steelhead), sensitivity to environmental
   stress (amphibians), and indicators of biodiversity (herpetofauna
   species richness). Herpetofauna species richness did not differ, but
   abundances of steelhead trout, signal crayfish, and amphibian richness
   all differed significantly among tributary types. Niche models indicated
   that distribution and abundance patterns in both riparian and aquatic
   environments were associated with physical and structural attributes at
   multiple spatial scales, both within and around reaches. The
   bio-indicators responded to unique sets of attributes, reflecting the
   high environmental heterogeneity in headwater tributaries across this
   large watershed. These niche attributes represented a wide range of
   headwater environments, indicating responses to a number of natural and
   anthropogenic conditions, and demonstrated the value of using a suite of
   bio indicators to elucidate watershed conditions, and to examine
   numerous disturbances that may influence ecological integrity.}},

   Hydrologic connectivity refers to the water-mediated transport of

   hydrologic connectivity warrant careful consideration in human-modified
   landscapes that are increasingly characterized by hydrologic alteration,
   exotic species, high levels of nutrients and toxins, and disturbed
   sediment regimes. While connectivity is integral to the structure and
   function of aquatic ecosystems, it can also promote the distribution of

   reduced hydrologic connectivity can provide greater ecological benefits
   than enhanced connectivity does in highly developed, human-modified

Abstract = {{Understanding the integrality and organization of wetlands system (WS)
   is important for system-level water resources management and ecological
   protection. Yet too little research delved into to the whole status
   assessment of these connected aquatic systems. In this paper, ecological
   network analysis (ENA) is introduced as a powerful methodology to
   develop insights into the integrality of Baiyangdian WS. A 23-components
   steady-state WS model is built on basin macrohydrology in 1962. We
   investigate how 18 ENA indicators that characterize ecosystem growth,
   development, and condition are affected by 8 scenarios including (1)
   increased boundary input, (2) decreased boundary input, (3) increased
   boundary output, (4) decreased boundary output, (5) addition of new
   pathway, (6) removal of component, (7) addition of new component and (8)
   addition of both new pathway and new component. Furthermore, we use
   coefficient of variation (CV) to compare system indicators' robustness
   to network changes. Scenario analyses demonstrate that following results
   regarding current network indicators: I. System indicators will response
   differently to different scenarios in different extent; II.
   Whole-indicators, such as Ascendency (A), are generally sensitive to
   network flow and topology changes; III. Ratio-based indicators and
   average mutual information (AMI) are basically with lower variability
   than non-ratio indicator. IV. Most of indictors present high sensitive
   to network topology changes even if there are few changes in total
   system throughput (TST). We hypothesize that WS are self-organized into
   a selective structure that exhibit certain criterion under favorable
   natural condition. This paper can promote the understanding of
   integrality of wetlands system and can be served as evidence supporting
   the need for wetlands policies that go beyond conservation of individual

   (Columbia County, Florida) and to determine the hydrological,
   geomorphic, and biological factors that influence those dynamics. Over a
   20-yr period of record, NO(3)-N removal averaged 118 kg N d(-1) (0.77 g
   N m(-2) d(-1)) over the upper 5 km of the Ichetucknee River. Three
   independent estimates of gross autotrophic N assimilation (from gross
   primary production, diel NO(3)(-) variation, and standing biomass)
   agreed closely but accounted for less than 20\% of observed N removal.
   Longitudinal surveys indicate negligible or negative dissolved organic
   nitrogen and ammonium (NH(4)(+)) production, suggesting that
   denitrification is the predominant mechanism of N removal in this river.
   A positive relationship between discharge and the magnitude of NO(3)-N
   removal shows that interactions with the surrounding floodplain exert
   considerable influence at high flows, and longitudinal NO(3)(-) patterns
   indicate that N removal may be influenced by channel morphology. These
   results suggest a greater role for dissimilatory processes and
   hydrologic connectivity with hyporheic and floodplain sediments than has
   been previously recognized in highly productive spring-fed rivers of
   north Florida. While hydrologic variation is the primary determinant of
   variation in NO(3)(-) removal within the Ichetucknee River, comparison
   across systems indicates that biotic characteristics can cause
   significant deviation from predictions based on purely physical models

Abstract = {{Debate exists about the effects of hydrological variation on food web
   dynamics and the relative importance of different sources of organic
   carbon fuelling food webs in floodplain rivers. Stable carbon isotope
   analyses and ecological stoichiometry were used to determine the basal
   sources in dry season macroinvertebrate food webs in two floodplain
   river systems of Australia's wet-dry tropics that have contrasting flow
   regimes. Algae, associated with phytoplankton and biofilm, were the
   primary food source, potentially contributing >55\% organic carbon to
   the biomass of a wide range of primary and secondary consumers. However,
   many consumers assimilated other sources in addition to algae, e. g.
   detritus from local C(3) riparian vegetation. Food webs were
   characterised by substantial flexibility in the number and types of
   sources identified as important, which was indicative of generalist
   feeding strategies. These findings suggest `dynamic stability' in the
   food webs, which imparts resilience against natural disturbances like
   flow regime seasonality and variation in hydrological connectivity. This
   adaptation may be characteristic of macroinvertebrate assemblages in
   highly seasonal river systems or in those with high levels of flow

Abstract = {{There is growing interest in rates of nitrate uptake and denitrification
   in restored streams to better understand the effects of restoration on
   nitrogen processing. This study quantified nitrate uptake in two
   restored and two unrestored streams in Baltimore, Maryland, USA using
   nitrate additions, denitrification enzyme assays, and a N-15 isotope
   tracer addition in one of the urban restored streams, Minebank Run.
   Restoration included either incorporation of stormwater ponds below a
   storm drain and catch basins to attenuate flow or hydrologic
   ``reconnection{''} of a stream channel to its floodplain. Stream
   restoration was conducted for restoring aging sanitary and bridge
   infrastructure and introducing some stormwater management in watersheds
   developed prior to current regulations. Denitrification potential in
   sediments was variable across streams, whereas nitrate uptake length
   appeared to be significantly correlated to surface water velocity, which
   was low in the restored streams during summer baseflow conditions.
   Uptake length of NO3 (-)-N in Minebank Run estimated by N-15 tracer
   addition was 556 m. Whole stream denitrification rates in Minebank Run
   were 153 mg NO3 (-)-N m(-2) day(-1), and approximately 40\% of the daily
   load of nitrate was estimated to be removed via denitrification over a
   distance of 220.5 m in a stream reach designed to be hydrologically
   ``connected{''} to its floodplain. Increased hydrologic residence time
   in Minebank Run during baseflow likely influenced rates of whole stream
   denitrification, suggesting that hydrologic residence time may be a key
   factor influencing N uptake and denitrification. Restoration approaches
   that increase hydrologic ``connectivity{''} with hyporheic sediments and
   increase hydrologic residence time may be useful for stimulating
   denitrification. More work is necessary, however, to examine changes in
   denitrification rates in restored streams across different seasons,
   variable N loads, and in response to the ``flashy{''} hydrologic flow
   conditions during storms common in urban streams.}},

Abstract = {{Rotifera density, biomass, and secondary production on two marginal
   lakes of Paranapanema River were compared after the recovery of
   hydrologic connectivity with the river (Sao Paulo State, Brazil). Daily
   samplings were performed in limnetic zone of both lakes during the rainy
   season immediately after lateral inflow of water and, in the dry period,
   six months after hydrologic connectivity recovery. In order to identify
   the factors that affect rotifer population dynamics, lake water level,
   volume, depth, temperature, transparency, dissolved oxygen, pH,
   alkalinity, conductivity, suspended solids, nutrients, and chlorophyll-a
   were determined. Variations of water physical and chemical factors that
   affect rotifer population were related to the lake-river degree of
   connection and to water level rising after drought. The water lateral
   inflow from the river resulted in an increase in lake water volume,
   depth, and transparency and a decrease in water pH, alkalinity, and
   suspended solids. The lake with the wider river connection, more
   frequent biota exchange, and larger amount of particulate and dissolved
   materials was richer and more diverse, while rotifer density, biomass,
   and productivity were lower in both periods studied. Density, biomass,
   and secondary production were higher in the lake with the smaller river
   connection and the higher physical and chemical stability. Our results
   show that the connectivity affects the limnological stability,

   in dry periods, were related with high density, biomass and secondary
   production. Conversely, instability conditions in rainy periods were

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{45}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{The adjustment of local vegetation conditions to limiting soil water by
   either maximizing productivity or minimizing water stress has been an
   area of central interest in ecohydrology since Eagleson's classic study.
   This work has typically been limited to consider one-dimensional
   exchange and cycling within patches and has not incorporated the effects
   of lateral redistribution of soil moisture, coupled ecosystem carbon and
   nitrogen cycling, and vegetation allocation processes along topographic
   gradients. We extend this theory to the hillslope and catchment scale,
   with in situ and downslope feedbacks between water, carbon and nutrient
   cycling within a fully transient, distributed model. We explore whether
   ecosystem patches linked along hydrologic flow paths as a catena evolve
   to form an emergent pattern optimized to local climate and topographic
   conditions. Lateral hydrologic connectivity of a small catchment is
   calibrated with streamflow data and further tested with measured soil
   moisture patterns. Then, the spatial gradient of vegetation density
   within a small catchment estimated with fine-resolution satellite
   imagery and field measurements is evaluated with simulated vegetation
   growth patterns from different root depth and allocation strategies as a
   function of hillslope position. This is also supported by the
   correspondence of modeled and field measured spatial patterns of root
   depths and catchment-level aboveground vegetation productivity. We test
   whether the simulated spatial pattern of vegetation corresponds to
   measured canopy patterns and an optimal state relative to a set of
   ecosystem processes, defined as maximizing ecosystem productivity and
   water use efficiency at the catchment scale. Optimal carbon uptake
   ranges show effective compromises between multiple resources (water,
   light, and nutrients), modulated by vegetation allocation dynamics along
   hillslope gradient.}},

Abstract = {{Although existing empirical studies of runoff generation in headwater
   catchments have provided evidence of runoff mechanisms, contributing
   sources and active flowpaths from forest catchments around the world,
   our understanding of how hydrologic and biological processes vary and
   aggregate in space within headwater systems remains poor. In this study,
   we examine the spatial patterns of storm runoff generation from eight
   small nested forest catchments ranging in size from 7 to 147 ha, as a
   function of antecedent moisture conditions and catchment morphology. The
   catchments, located in the formerly glaciated terrain of Mont
   Saint-Hilaire, Quebec, Canada, are complex in both their topographic and
   subsurface characterization. Hydrologic response from the eight
   catchments shows a strong nonlinear change with antecedent moisture
   conditions consistent with the hypothesis of different
   `states-of-wetness'. With the transition from wet to dry conditions,
   local groundwater stores become depleted in some ephemeral catchments,
   variable source areas shrink and new-water delivered by
   shallow-subsurface stormflow and the transient development of perched
   water in valley-bottoms can account for much larger percentages of total
   runoff (up to 76\% of total runoff). For the five storm events, no
   consistent pattern in percent new-water delivery was observed. However,
   for the storms observed under dry conditions, larger magnitudes of new
   water were generated from the three largest catchments attributable to
   basin morphology, while storms observed under wet conditions exhibited
   no consistent pattern, with larger variability among the smaller
   catchments. The results presented here illustrate the complexity of
   influences of antecedent moisture conditions and catchment morphology on
   spatial patterns of runoff generation in headwater systems. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Unlike long-term heating in subsiding sedimentary basins, the
   near-instantaneous thermal maturation of sedimentary organic matter near
   magmatic intrusions is comparable to artificial thermal maturation in
   the laboratory in terms of short duration and limited extent. This study
   investigates chemical and H, C, N, O isotopic changes in high volatile
   bituminous coal near two Illinois dike contacts and compares observed
   patterns and trends with data from other published studies and from
   artificial maturation experiments. Our study pioneers in quantifying
   isotopically exchangeable hydrogen and measuring the D/H (i.e.,
   (2)H/(1)H) ratio of isotopically non-exchangeable organic hydrogen in
   kerogen near magmatic contacts. Thermal stress in coal caused a
   reduction of isotopically exchangeable hydrogen in kerogen from 5\% to
   6\% in unaltered coal to 2-3\% at contacts, mostly due to elimination of
   functional groups (e. g., -OH, -COOH, -NH(2)). In contrast to all
   previously published data on D/H in thermally matured organic matter,
   the more mature kerogen near the two dike contacts is D-depleted, which
   is attributed to (i) thermal elimination of D-enriched functional
   groups, and (ii) thermal drying of hydrologically isolated coal prior to
   the onset of cracking reactions, thereby precluding D-transfer from
   relatively D-enriched water into kerogen. Maxima in organic nitrogen
   concentration and in the atomic N/C ratio of kerogen at a distance of
   similar to 2.5 to similar to 3.5 m from the thicker dike indicate that
   reactive N-compounds had been pyrolytically liberated at high
   temperature closer to the contact, migrated through the coal seam, and
   recombined with coal kerogen in a zone of lower temperature. The same
   principle extends to organic carbon, because a strong
   delta(13)C(kerogen) vs. delta(15)N(kerogen) correlation across 5.5 m of
   coal adjacent to the thicker dike indicates that coal was functioning as
   a flow-through reactor along a dynamic thermal gradient facilitating
   back-reactions between mobile pyrolysis products from the hot zone as
   they encounter less hot kerogen. Vein and cell filling carbonate is most
   abundant in highest rank coals where carbonate delta(13)C(VPDB) and
   delta(18)O(VSMOW) values are consistent with thermal generation of
   (13)C-depleted and (18)O-enriched CO(2) from decarboxylation and
   pyrolysis of organic matter. Lower background concentrations of
   (13)C-enriched carbonate in thermally unaffected coal may be linked to
   (13)C-enrichment in residual CO(2) in the process of CO(2) reduction via
   microbial methanogenesis.
   Our compilation and comparison of available organic H, C, N isotopic
   findings on magmatic intrusions result in re-assessments of majors
   factors influencing isotopic shifts in kerogen during magmatic heating.
   (i) Thermally induced shifts in organic delta D values of kerogen are
   primarily driven by the availability of water or steam. Hydrologic
   isolation (e. g., near Illinois dikes) results in organic D-depletion in
   kerogen, whereas more common hydrologic connectivity results in organic
   D-enrichment. (ii) Shifts in kerogen (or coal) delta(13)C and delta(15)N
   values are typically small and may follow sinusoidal patterns over short
   distances from magmatic contacts. Laterally limited sampling strategies
   may thus result in misleading and non-representative data. (iii) Fluid
   transport of chemically active, mobile carbon and nitrogen species and
   recombination reactions with kerogen result in isotopic changes in
   kerogen that are unrelated to the original, autochthonous part of
   kerogen. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Different species dominated in each of the three wetlands. When we

Abstract = {{Relationships explaining streamflow behaviour in terms of drainage basin
   physiography greatly assist efforts to extrapolate streamflow metrics
   from gauged to ungauged basins in the same landscape. The Dorset
   Environmental Science Centre (DESC) has monitored streamflow from 22
   small basins (3.4-190.5 ha) on the Precambrian Shield in south-central
   Ontario, in some cases since 1976. The basins exhibit regional coherence
   in their interannual response to precipitation; however, there is often
   a poor correlation between streamflow metrics from basins separated by
   as little as 1 km. This study assesses whether inter-basin variations in
   such metrics can be explained in terms of basin scale and physiography.
   Several characteristics (annual maximum, minimum and average flow)
   exhibited simple scaling with basin area, while magnitude, range and
   timing of annual maximum daily runoff showed scaling behaviour
   consistent with the Representative Elementary Area (REA) concept. This
   REA behaviour is partly attributed to convergence of fractional coverage
   of the two dominant and hydrologically-contrasting land cover types in
   the DESC region with increasing basin size. Three Principal Components
   (PCs) explained 82.4\% of the variation among basin physiographic
   properties, and several runoff metrics (magnitude and timing of annual
   minimum daily runoff, mean number of days per year with 0 streamflow)
   exhibited significant relationships with one or more PC. Significant
   relationships were obtained between basin quickflow (QF) production and
   the PCs on a seasonal and annual basis, almost all of which were
   superior to simple area-based relationships. Basin physiography
   influenced QF generation via its control on slope runoff, water storage
   and hydrologic connectivity; however, this role was minimized during
   Spring when QF production in response to large rain-on-snow events was
   relatively uniform across the DESC basins. The PC-based relationships
   and inter-seasonal changes in their form were consistent with previous
   research conducted at point, slope and basin scales in the DESC region,
   and perceptions of key hydrological processes in these small basins may
   not have been as readily obtained from scaling studies using streamflow
   from larger basins. This process understanding provides insights into
   scaling behaviour beyond those derived from simple scaling and REA
   analyses. The physiography of the study area is representative of large
   portions of the Precambrian Shield, such that basin streamflow behaviour
   could potentially be extended across much of south-central Ontario. This
   would assist predictions of streamflow conditions at ungauged locations,
   development and testing of hydrological models for this landscape, and
   interpretation of inter-basin and intra-annual differences in
   hydrochemical behaviour on the southern Precambrian Shield. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{A river lateral lake (Coqueiral Lake marginal to Paranapanema River in

   fragmentation into four small isolated bodies of water during a
   prolonged drought period, disrupting the link with the river. The aim of
   this work was to compare the temporal modifications on zooplankton
   community structure (total abundance, species richness, and diversity)
   in the four water bodies. Zooplankton samplings and abiotic factor
   measurements were made in two periods - during isolation phase of the
   lake in relation to river and after re-establishment of hydrologic
   connectivity. A concentration effect on zooplankton abundance was
   recorded with drought progression, but without significant modifications
   in species richness and diversity. When the river inundation pulse
   occurred, a reduction in total zooplankton density was observed due to
   the dilution effect and a significant increase in species richness and
   diversity was recorded. Lateral water influx from the river to the
   lacustrine environment acts as a temporary disturbance factor on the
   zooplankton community structure. Zooplankton species composition
   presented some modifications between the two periods. Zooplankton
   organism drift in water from the river to the lake, removal of
   individuals from the aquatic macrophytes, and eclosion of resting eggs
   from sediment are probable factors that can increase zooplankton species
   richness immediately after lateral pulse inundation with water by the

   sediment through landscapes. Although coupling is well known to control
   long-term landscape development and shorter-term sensitivity to
   disturbance, the anthropogenic influences on coupling are seldom
   considered in hydrologic investigations. In particular, the building of
   small-scale water diversion (earth banks) and collection (farm dams)
   infrastructure on hillslopes in dryland agricultural areas may
   significantly alter hillslopechannel coupling. Twelve sub-catchment
   basins in a dryland agricultural region were investigated under their
   natural (ignoring infrastructure) and modified (including
   infrastructure) conditions to investigate the influence of water
   collection infrastructure on hydrologic connectivity, and whether manual
   modification of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) could account for the
   impact of these factors in hydrologic simulation of hydrologic and
   geomorphic processes.
   Dam numbers and density have both increased over the period of available
   aerial photography (19651999), resulting in an average 39.5\% reduction
   (range 4.3-86.7\%) in the area retaining hydrologic connectivity with
   the basin outlet. Analysis of basins dominated by either banks or dams,
   and with combinations of both was performed using the Cumulative Area
   Distribution (CAD), Hypsometric Curve (HC), Simplified Width Function
   (SWF) and Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph (IUH). The geomorphic
   descriptors (CAD and HC) showed little change in basin structure as a
   result of farm dam and bank construction, but hydrologic descriptors
   (SWF and IUH) indicate that hillslope processes are significantly
   altered by farm dams and banks. Because runoff models are sensitive to
   catchment area, incorporating hillslope water capture and diversion
   infrastructure into the base data sets may offer a solution to improved
   parameterisation of spatial models of hydrology, particularly in dryland
   agricultural regions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between food web dynamics and hydrological connectivity
   in rivers should be strongly influenced by annual flood pulses that
   affect primary production dynamics and movement of organic matter and
   consumer taxa. We sampled basal production sources and fishes from
   connected lagoons and the main channel of a low-gradient, floodplain
   river within the Orinoco River Basin in Venezuela. Stable isotope
   analysis was used to model the contribution of four basal production
   Sources to fishes, and to examine patterns of mean trophic position
   during the falling-water period of the annual flood cycle. IsoSource, a
   multi-source mixing model, indicated that proportional contributions
   from production sources to fish assemblages were similar in lagoons and
   the main channel. Although distributions differed, the means for trophic
   positions of fish assemblages as well as individual species were similar
   between the two habitats. These findings contradict recent food web
   studies conducted in temperate floodplain rivers that described
   significant differences in trophic positions of fishes from slackwater
   and floodplain versus main channel habitats. Low between-habitat trophic
   variation in this tropical river probably results from an extended
   annual flood pulse (ca. 5 mo.) that allows mixing of sestonic and
   allochthonous basal production Sources and extensive lateral movements

Abstract = {{Dynamics of nutrient exchange between floodplains and rivers have been
   altered by changes in flow management and proliferation of nonnative
   plants. We tested the hypothesis that the nonnative, actinorhizal tree,
   Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia), alters dynamics of leaf litter
   decomposition compared to native cottonwood (Populus deltoides ssp.
   wislizeni) along the Rio Grande, a river with a modified flow regime, in
   central New Mexico (USA). Leaf litter was placed in the river channel
   and the surface and subsurface horizons of forest soil at seven riparian
   sites that differed in their hydrologic connection to the river. All
   sites had a cottonwood canopy with a Russian olive-dominated understory.
   Mass loss rates, nutrient content, fungal biomass, extracellular enzyme
   activities (EEA), and macroinvertebrate colonization were followed for
   three months in the river and one year in forests. Initial nitrogen (N)
   content of Russian olive litter (2.2\%) was more than four times that of
   cottonwood (0.5\%). Mass loss rates (k; in units of d(-1)) were greatest
   in the river (Russian olive, k = 0.0249; cottonwood, k = 0.0226),
   intermediate in subsurface soil (Russian olive, k = 0.0072; cottonwood,
   k = 0.0031), and slowest on the soil surface (Russian olive, k = 0.0034;
   cottonwood, k = 0.0012) in a ratio of about 10:2:1. Rates of mass loss
   in the river were indistinguishable between species and proportional to
   macroinvertebrate colonization. In the riparian forest, Russian olive
   decayed significantly faster than cottonwood in both soil horizons.
   Terrestrial decomposition rates were related positively to EEA, fungal
   biomass, and litter N, whereas differences among floodplain sites were
   related to hydrologic connectivity with the river. Because nutrient
   exchanges between riparian forests and the river have been constrained
   by flow management, Russian olive litter represents a significant annual
   input of N to riparian forests, which now retain a large portion of
   slowly decomposing cottonwood litter with a high potential for N
   immobilization. As a result, retention and mineralization of litter N
   within these forests is controlled by hydrologic connectivity to the
   river, which affects litter export and in situ decomposition.}},

Abstract = {{Data on vegetation composition and structure, soil and leaf nutrient
   pools, soil redox potential, and surface water hydrologic connectivity
   were collected from floodplains along six river reaches in western
   Tennessee to examine the effects of channel modifications on associated
   riparian systems. Comparisons among channelization treatments
   (non-channelized reaches, channelized and leveed reaches, channelized
   but non-leveed reaches) and floodplain geomorphology (depression and
   nondepressional sites) showed that hydrologic connectivity was affected
   by channelization treatments, particularly leveeing. The disconnected
   floodplains were drier, maintained higher nutrient pools, and had
   greater herbaceous biomass than floodplains still connected to channel
   hydrology. Runoff onto floodplains from the agriculturally dominated
   landscape of channelized and leveed tributaries, and flooding stress in
   the form of scour on floodplains along streams without levees may
   explain the observed pattern. Channel and floodplain hydrologic
   processes were most strongly connected for unchannelized streams.
   Unchannelized streams were varied in soil redox potential, water table,
   and nutrient pools. Vegetation composition reflects both historical
   hydrologic regimes and disturbances, and thus complex relationships to
   channel modifications. Results suggest both the subsidy (i.e., nutrient
   inputs) and the stress of flood events have been altered by
   anthropogenic activities, but these alterations were greatest in
   channelized systems compared to unchannelized systems.}},

Abstract = {{Floodplain ecosystems of the southeastern United States provide numerous
   services to society, but hydrologic and geomorphic alterations,
   agricultural practices, water quality and availability, and urban
   development continue to challenge restorationists and managers at
   multiple spatial and temporal scales. These challenges are further
   exacerbated by tremendous uncertainty regarding climate and land use
   patterns and natural variability in these systems. The symposium from
   which the papers in 2009 ensued was organized to provide a critical
   evaluation of current natural resource restoration and management
   practices to support the sustainability of floodplain ecosystem
   functions in the southeastern United States. In this paper we synthesize
   these concepts and evaluate restoration and conservation techniques in
   light of our understanding of these ecosystems. We also discuss current
   and future challenges and attempt to identify new approaches that may
   facilitate the long-term sustainability of southeastern floodplain
   systems. We conclude that integration of disciplines and approaches is
   necessary to meet the floodplain conservation challenges of the coming
   century. Integration will not only include purposeful dialogue between
   interdisciplinary natural resource professionals, but it also is
   necessary to sincerely engage the public about goals, objectives, and

   salinity, and nutrients were examined in intermittently connected marsh
   ponds in the subtropical Guadalupe Estuary, Texas, USA to determine the
   effects of hydrologic connections on algal biomass in this system. From
   May 2005 to May 2006, several high water events resulting in surface
   water connections between ponds and nearby tidal creeks occurred,
   followed by disconnection and, at times, pond desiccation. During
   periods of disconnection, algal biomass was higher in both the benthos

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{45}},
Month = {{MAY 28}},
Abstract = {{This study utilizes 7 years of continuously monitored groundwater-level
   data from four sites along the Rio Grande riparian corridor in central
   New Mexico to calculate evapotranspiration from groundwater and assess
   impacts of understory vegetation removal during a restoration project.
   Diurnal groundwater fluctuation measurements were used to compare the
   well-known White method for estimating evapotranspiration from
   groundwater (ETg) to colocated measurements of total riparian
   evapotranspiration (ET) measured using the eddy covariance method. On
   average, the two methods were linearly correlated and had similar
   variability, but groundwater hydrograph estimates of ETg tended to be
   larger than tower ET estimates. Average ETg estimates for two wells at
   one site ranged from 91.45\% to 164.77\% of measured tower ET estimates,
   but were also shown to range from 57.35\% to 254.34\% at another site.
   Comparisons between the methods improved with deeper water tables,
   reduced groundwater and river connectivity, and where soil profiles were
   dominated by coarse-sized particles. Using a range of texturebased
   estimates of specific yield (Sy) with water table position improves the
   field application of the White method. River-induced fluctuations in
   groundwater increased the variability of ETg measurements. Removal of
   understory vegetation at one site resulted in a small but significant
   reduction in diel groundwater fluctuation amplitude of 19-21\%. Caution
   is required when understory vegetation removal is used as a means to
   decrease overall riparian ET. Diel groundwater fluctuation amplitudes
   can be useful in gauging the hydrological effects of vegetation removal.
   Riparian groundwater hydrographs are critical to investigating the
   hydrologic connectivity between river and shallow groundwater, the
   temporal patterns of vegetative consumption, and monitoring changes to
   the vegetation community.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between catchment structure and runoff characteristics
   is poorly understood. In steep headwater catchments with shallow soils
   the accumulation of hillslope area (upslope accumulated area (UAA)) is a
   hypothesized first-order control on the distribution of soil water and
   groundwater. Hillslope-riparian water table connectivity represents the
   linkage between the dominant catchment landscape elements (hillslopes
   and riparian zones) and the channel network. Hydrologic connectivity
   between hillslope-riparian-stream (HRS) landscape elements is
   heterogeneous in space and often temporally transient. We sought to test
   the relationship between UAA and the existence and longevity of HRS
   shallow groundwater connectivity. We quantified water table connectivity
   based on 84 recording wells distributed across 24 HRS transects within
   the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest (U. S. Forest Service),
   northern Rocky Mountains, Montana. Correlations were observed between
   the longevity of HRS water table connectivity and the size of each
   transect's UAA (r(2) = 0.91). We applied this relationship to the entire
   stream network to quantify landscape-scale connectivity through time and
   ascertain its relationship to catchment-scale runoff dynamics. We found
   that the shape of the estimated annual landscape connectivity duration
   curve was highly related to the catchment flow duration curve (r(2) =

Abstract = {{The North American monsoon is a key feature affecting summer climate
   over Southwestern North America. During the monsoon, evapotranspiration
   from the Southwest promotes transference of water to the atmosphere

   degree to which atmospheric connectivity redistributes monsoonal
   terrestrial moisture throughout the continent and its sensitivity to
   climate disturbances such as drought is uncertain. We tracked the
   trajectory of moisture evapotranspired within the semiarid Southwest

   moisture was advected north-east accounting for similar to 15\% of
   precipitation in adjacent Great Plains regions. During recent drought

   wetlands scored higher than reference sites for providing vertebrate
   habitat structure. Analysis of individual model variables showed that
   reference wetlands had greater vegetative biomass and higher soil
   organic matter content than both created wetland age classes. Created
   wetlands were farther from natural wetlands and had smaller mean forest
   patch sizes within a 1-km-radius circle around the site than did the

Title = {{Linking soils and streams: Sources and chemistry of dissolved organic
   matter in a small coastal watershed}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{45}},
Month = {{MAR 25}},
Abstract = {{To understand the hydrologic and biogeochemical controls on the age and
   recalcitrance of dissolved organic matter (DOM) found in stream waters,
   we combined hydrometric monitoring along a topographic gradient from
   ridge to channel with isotopic (C-13 and C-14) and spectroscopic (UV and
   C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance) analyses of soil and stream water
   samples in a small coastal watershed in California. With increasing
   discharge, dissolved organic carbon concentrations increased from 2.2 to
   10.9 mg C L-1, Delta C-14 values increased from -125 to +120 parts per
   thousand, delta C-13 values decreased from -24 to -29 parts per
   thousand, C:N ratios increased from 6.5 to 15.4, and specific UV
   adsorption increased from 1.4 to 3.8 L mg C-1 m(-1). These changes in
   DOM composition are consistent with a shift in source from old and
   recalcitrant soil organic matter (OM) sources found in deep soil
   horizons to young and relatively fresh OM sources found in the surface
   horizons. Results from this study suggest upland soils of the watershed
   become DOM production limited as indicated by a seasonal depletion and
   chemical shift in soil DOM, whereas highly productive soils in the
   hollow act as a near-infinite DOM source. Hydrologic connectivity of
   this DOM-rich riparian source region to the stream ultimately constrains
   DOM export, and the stream DOM composition reflects the combined
   influence of soil biogeochemical cycling of OM and hydrologic routing of
   water through the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Floodplain habitats have been inferred to provide a variety of functions
   for aquatic organisms, yet few studies have documented movement between
   channel and aquatic floodplain habitats. We exploited spatial variation
   in stable isotope ratios of gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) to
   document movement between floodplain lakes and the main river channel of
   the Brazos River, Texas, during a period of frequent hydrologic
   connectivity. Additionally, we examined stomach contents of shad to
   determine if ontogenetic diet shifts or faunal exchange best explained
   variation in isotopic ratios. Regression analysis indicated significant
   relationships between gizzard shad size and isotopic ratios in oxbow
   lakes, whereas these relationships were not significant for the main
   channel. Plots of individual fish in each habitat suggested that adult
   shad migrated into oxbow lakes during floods whereas juveniles
   assimilated material produced in oxbows. Some adults in oxbows had
   signatures similar to juveniles, and these individuals were probably
   long-term oxbow residents. The proportion of adults with a ``river{''}
   signature was greater in the oxbow with the shortest flood recurrence
   interval where opportunities for faunal exchange were more frequent.
   Analysis of stomach contents indicated almost total overlap between
   adult and juvenile diets indicating that movement between habitats
   having different isotopic ratios of basal resources rather than
   ontogenetic dietary shifts best explained patterns of isotopic variation
   in Brazos River gizzard shad.}},

Title = {{Influence of lateral gradients of hydrologic connectivity on trophic

Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{607-620}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Riverscapes consist of the main channel and lateral slackwater habitats
   along a gradient of hydrological connectivity from maximum connection in
   main channel habitats to minimum connection in backwaters.
   Spatiotemporal differences in water currents along this gradient produce
   dynamic habitat conditions that influence species diversity, population
   densities and trophic interactions of fishes.
   We examined the importance of lateral connectivity gradients for food
   web dynamics in the Upper Mississippi River during spring (high flow,
   moderately low temperatures) and summer (low flow, higher temperatures).
   We used literature information and gut contents analyses to determine
   feeding guilds and stable isotope analysis to estimate mean trophic
   position of local fish assemblages. During June and August 2006, we
   collected over 1000 tissue samples from four habitats (main channel,
   secondary channels, tertiary channels and backwaters) distributed within
   four hydrologic connectivity gradients.
   Mean trophic position differed among feeding guilds and seasons, with
   highest values in spring. Mean trophic position of fish assemblages,
   variability in trophic position and food chain length (maximum trophic
   position) of the two dominant piscivore species (Micropterus salmoides
   and M. dolomieu) in both seasons were significantly associated with
   habitat along the lateral connectivity gradient. Food chain length
   peaked in tertiary channels in both seasons, probably due to higher
   species diversity of prey at these habitats. We infer that food chain
   length and trophic position of fish assemblages were lower in backwater
   habitats in the summer mainly because of the use of alternative food
   sources in these habitats.
   A greater number of conspecifics exhibited significant among-habitat
   variation in trophic position during the summer, indicating that low
   river stages can constrain fish movements in the Upper Mississippi
   River.
   Results of this study should provide a better understanding of the
   fundamental structure of large river ecosystems and an improved basis
   for river rehabilitation and management through knowledge of the
   importance of lateral complexity in rivers.}},

Abstract = {{Systematic conservation planning research has focused on designing
   systems of conservation areas that efficiently protect a comprehensive
   and representative set of species and habitats. Recently, there has been
   an emphasis on improving the adequacy of conservation area design to
   promote the persistence and future generation of biodiversity. Few
   studies have explored incorporating ecological and evolutionary
   processes into conservation planning assessments. Biodiversity in
   Australia is maintained and generated by numerous ecological and
   evolutionary processes at various spatial and temporal scales. We
   accommodated ecological and evolutionary processes in four ways: ( 1)
   using sub-catchments as planning units to facilitate the protection of
   the integrity and function of ecosystem processes occurring on a
   sub-catchment scale; ( 2) targeting one type of ecological refugia,
   drought refugia, which are critical for the persistence of many species
   during widespread drought; ( 3) targeting one type of evolutionary
   refugia which are important for maintaining and generating unique biota
   during long-term climatic changes; and ( 4) preferentially grouping
   priority areas along vegetated waterways to account for the importance
   of connected waterways and associated riparian areas in maintaining
   processes. We identified drought refugia, areas of relatively high and
   regular herbage production in arid and semiarid Australia, from
   estimates of gross primary productivity derived from satellite data. In
   this paper, we combined the novel incorporation of these processes with
   a more traditional framework of efficiently representing a comprehensive
   sample of biodiversity to identify spatial priorities across Australia.
   We explored the trade-offs between economic costs, representation
   targets, and connectivity. Priority areas that considered ecological and
   evolutionary processes were more connected along vegetated waterways and
   were identified for a small increase in economic cost. Priority areas
   for conservation investment are more likely to have long-term benefits
   to biodiversity if ecological and evolutionary processes are considered
   in their identification.}},

Abstract = {{Reengineering of stream channels is a common approach used to restore

   prerestoration and postrestoration hydrology. Results show that
   restoration has a seasonal impact with statistically significant
   increases in streamflow during the summer recession period and decreased
   groundwater table depths across a wide range of streamflow conditions.
   Paired gauges and statistical models that are robust to serial

Abstract = {{The decommissioning of roads is occurring in many forest environments
   with the aim of reducing the negative impacts of road runoff on water
   quality and aquatic habitat. Works associated with decommissioning are
   expensive so prior assessment of the outcomes of various options is
   merited. This paper presents a method of quantifying the degree to which
   a road is hydrologically connected to the stream network and thus the
   likely impacts of constructing a road of different configurations upon
   water quality. The method permits comparisons between different road
   network management options and is useful for assessing the likely result
   of decommissioning works. Emphasis is placed on quantifying the
   uncertainty of key performance measures. The procedures developed here
   are an extension of the probabilistic `volume to breakthrough' model
   recently formulated by Australian water quality researchers and allow
   the quantification of road/stream connectivity without the need for
   extensive parameterization. To demonstrate its utility, the model was
   applied to an actual road decommissioning and replacement project in
   southeast Australia. Road areas and drainage outlets were surveyed in
   the field and flow paths to streams derived from a I metre resolution
   LiDAR based digital elevation model. The results demonstrate that the
   actual road decommissioning examined in this case was unlikely to reduce
   runoff to the stream network and that the overall impact of the works in
   conditions of design storms are likely to result in a net reduction in

Abstract = {{Modelling the hydrologic processes of semiarid basins is specially
   challenging due to the specific characteristics of this type of
   environment. The discontinuity of the processes both in space and in
   time produces a highly complicated rainfall-runoff relationship. Runoff
   production and reinfiltration areas produce a discontinuous spatial
   pattern of runoff; channel flow is ephemeral and restricted to the wet
   season of the year or to heavy rainfalls, and many local saturated
   layers of soil separated by unsaturated areas can occur. The
   hydrological connection of the different parts of the basin produces a
   nonlinear and complex hydrologic behaviour because different response
   mechanisms of the basin are triggered as the hydrological connectivity
   increases. Similarly, as connectivity decreases, so does the information
   arriving at the monitored state variables used to calibrate the model
   and to understand the system. This paper describes the application of a
   distributed hydrologic model to describe the hydrologic behaviour of a
   small semiarid basin including surface and subsurface processes. The
   model is parameterized and calibrated to simulate a period of 71 days
   covering the transition of the basin from a dry to a wet state, during
   which most of the hydrologic processes of the basin are activated. The
   calibration strategy used different sources and types of information on
   the state of the basin and an efficient gradient based search algorithm
   to find the optimal values of the most sensitive parameters. The
   modelled hydrograph and the modelled internal description of the basin
   were analysed in the light of its known behaviour and the existing
   knowledge of semiarid hydrology reported in the literature. The results
   indicate that while the integrated behaviour of the basin represented by
   the output hydrograph can be well reproduced, the subsurface processes
   and the internal dynamics of the basin are less accurately simulated,
   mainly due to the lack of information on the geometry of the subsurface
   domain (soil depths and bedrock topography) and on the spatial
   distribution of the parameters. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Algal carbon has been increasingly recognized as the primary carbon
   source supporting large-river food webs; however, many of the studies
   that support this contention have focused on lotic main channels during
   low-flow periods. The flow variability and habitat-heterogeneity
   characteristic of these systems has the potential to significantly
   influence food web structure and must be integrated into models of
   large-river webs. We used stable-isotope analysis and IsoSource software
   to model terrestrial and algal sources of organic carbon supporting
   consumer taxa in the main channel and oxbow lakes of the Brazos River,
   Texas, USA, during a period of frequent hydrologic connectivity between
   these habitat types. Standardized sampling was conducted monthly to
   collect production sources and consumer species used in isotopic
   analysis. Predictability of hydrologic connections between habitat types
   was based on the previous 30 years of flow data. IsoSource mixing models
   identified terrestrial C(3) macrophytes ( riparian origin) as the
   primary carbon source supporting virtually all consumers in the main
   channel and most consumers in oxbow lakes. Small-bodied consumers (<100
   mm) in oxbow lakes assimilated large fractions of algal carbon whereas
   this pattern was not apparent in the main channel. Estimates of
   detritivore trophic positions based on delta(15)N values indicated that
   terrestrial material was likely assimilated via invertebrates rather
   than directly from detritus. High flows in the river channel influenced
   algal standing stock, and differences in the importance of terrestrial
   and algal production sources among consumers in channel vs. oxbow
   habitats were associated with patterns of flooding. The importance of
   terrestrial material contradicts the findings of recent studies of
   large-river food webs that have emphasized the importance of algal
   carbon and indicates that there can be significant spatial, temporal,
   and taxonomic variation in carbon sources supporting consumers in large
   rivers.}},

Abstract = {{Floodplain lakes are especially dynamic due to the irregular flow regime
   of the Parani River and its location along the geomorphologic gradient
   between the lakes and the river. The response of Eichhornia crassipes
   (Mart.) Solms (one of the most frequent aquatic plant) was studied in
   two floodplain lakes with different flooding regimes. Samples were taken
   between March 1997 and December 2001 on 13 different hydrologic
   conditions during prolonged hydrologic connection and prolonged
   hydrologic isolation. Leaf height, leaf density, biomass and nutrient
   content of the mature leaves of E. crassipes were measured and related
   to water level fluctuation and the hydrologic connectivity. The lake
   more connected with the main channel had a long lasting inundation
   phase. In this condition the surface area covered by water increased
   more than three times compared to prolonged hydrologic isolation
   condition. As river water entered the floodplain lakes, dissolved
   inorganic nitrogen increased to high values, especially NO(3)(-),
   whereas the isolation condition was characterised by a decrease in
   NO(3)(-) concentrations to undetectable levels. Compared to plants
   growing in the more isolated take, those growing in the more connected
   lake had a significantly lower leaf density, longer leaves, less root
   biomass and lower ratio between below-ground and above-ground biomasses.
   However, total and leaf biomasses were not significantly different
   between sites. In each lake, differences in leaf height, leaf biomass
   and root biomass between prolonged hydrologic connection and isolation,
   as well as the insignificant relationship between leaf size and leaf
   density, indicate that the morphological traits of E. crassipes respond
   to pluri-annual water level fluctuations. The highest nutrient
   concentration in mature leaves was registered at the end of the
   prolonged hydrologic connection in the more connected lake. During the
   prolonged isolation, leaves had more lignin and a higher UN ratio than
   at high waters, at the same sites. The success of E. crassipes in
   occupying habitats subjected to wide and erratic fluctuations in water
   level, such as the Parana River floodplain, appears to be related to its
   ability to modify morphological traits according to water level.}},

Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effects of river floodpulses on the water chemistry
   and diatom assemblages in a floodplain wetland. During the two year
   study period (November 2003-September 2005), the river and wetland
   exhibited three periods of surface hydrologic connectivity. The impacts
   of flooding depended on flood magnitude and duration. Both the long/high
   magnitude and short/high magnitude floods thoroughly mixed river and
   wetland waters, with conductivity, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus
   in the wetland decreasing to levels similar to the river. In contrast,
   the short/low magnitude flood did not mix water chemistry. Wetland
   conductivity, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus remained elevated.
   Changes in algal biomass followed changes in water chemistry with the
   high magnitude floods producing conditions unfavorable for algal growth.
   Algal biomass decreased in the wetland coinciding with the two high
   magnitude floods. Increases in algal biomass coincided with the
   short/low magnitude flood. Wetland and river water column diatom
   assemblages were dominated by periphytic taxa. The diatom assemblage in
   the river and wetland were distinct, except during the short/high
   magnitude flood. During this period, floodwaters brought diatoms into
   the wetland and both systems were dominated by planktonic centric taxa.
   Similar diatom taxa were observed in the wetland water column assemblage
   and the assemblage collected in settling chambers, although their
   relative abundances varied. Shifts in the settling diatom assemblage
   coincided with periods of flooding, indicating that river floodwaters
   leave a discernable signal within this assemblage. Our findings indicate
   that caution should be exercised when using diatom-based bioassessment
   in frequently flooded wetlands as the wetland diatom assemblage is
   influenced by river floodwaters and changes may depend on the duration
   and magnitude of flooding.}},

   existing theoretical models of floodplain recharge fail to capture
   observed patterns of inundation in the PAD. Instead, we find a dichotomy
   between the distributary channel network, which responds to summer
   high-water events, and floodplain lakes and wetlands, which do not. The
   latter occurs even where hydrologic connections do exist between the
   two. Results have strong management implications for the impact of

Abstract = {{Ecosystem fragmentation is one of the most damaging anthropogenic
   impacts to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. In this study,
   we analyzed population-level characteristics of a resilient top
   predator, the gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus), across a gradient of
   fragmentation in Bahamian tidal creeks. Analysis of hydrologic
   connectivity (the inverse of fragmentation) and site-specific population
   parameters revealed that varying degrees of connectivity translated into
   predictable characteristics in fish populations. Less-fragmented systems
   produced fast-growing snapper with high condition factors, whereas more
   fragmented tidal creeks yielded slow-growing snapper with low condition
   factors. Underlying reasons for growth rate differences likely
   originated from structural and functional shifts in tidal creek
   ecosystems following fragmentation. Such ecosystem-level shifts were
   reflected by low per-individual volumes of consumed prey, as well as
   increased parasite infestations. Results indicated that aquatic
   ecosystem fragmentation may affect long-term fitness and viability of
   resilient species capable of persisting in fragmented habitats. Our
   results from estuarine tidal creeks compare well with studies on

Volume = {{141}},

Abstract = {{The process of designing protected areas to represent all ecosystems in
   an area adequately is becoming increasingly sophisticated. To date
   freshwater aquatic ecosystems have seldom been considered in this
   process. How much of a difference does it make when they are considered
   as well?
   This study examined the conservation of riverine biodiversity within 17
   assessment units contained by the catchment areas of five perennial
   rivers flowing through Kruger National Park and two seasonal rivers that
   are largely contained within this park. Physical river types, fish
   species and invertebrate families or genera were used as surrogates of
   riverine biodiversity. Conservation planning software was used to select
   an optimal set of planning units to represent and maintain riverine
   biodiversity.
   The current spatial configuration of Kruger National Park, largely an
   accident of history, is particularly poor when assessed against the
   objective of conserving riverine biodiversity. Several alternative
   layouts are examined. These options are theoretical since there is
   little current opportunity to reassign land uses in the region. This
   study shows that substantially improved layouts for both riverine and
   terrestrial biodiversity are possible, under the constraint of the same
   total area under protection. The study also shows that even these
   optimal layouts are only partially successful in efforts to conserve
   fully representative samples of riverine biodiversity. Because of the
   longitudinal connectivity of rivers, conservation strategies that extend
   beyond protected areas are essential. Explicit conservation visions,
   targets and strategies need to be included in integrated water resource
   management plans.
   Based on the results of this study, nine recommendations are provided
   for increasing the effectiveness of current and future protected areas
   in conserving riverine biodiversity. These are to use systematic
   conservation planning to make biodiversity benefits explicit; mend the
   disconnect between terrestrial and freshwater conservation; use multiple
   surrogates wherever possible; be strategic about the collection and
   management of primary data; strive for maximum hydrologic connectivity;
   resist development pressure; foster good relationships across park
   fences; where relevant, pursue multi-national cooperation at the basin
   scale; and engage the value debate and resolve awareness and capacity
   constraints. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wetlands are more threatened than any other ecosystem type, with losses
   exceeding 50\% of their original extent worldwide. Despite the small
   portion of the Earth's surface that they comprise, wetlands contribute
   significantly to global ecosystem services. In this study, we tested the
   hypothesis that the location and rate of change in wetland amount in the
   Tempisque Basin of northwest Costa Rica is predictable from landscape
   setting. Our results demonstrate that a strong potential exists for
   developing predictive models of wetland conversion based on an
   understanding of wetland location and surrounding trends of land use. We
   found that topography was the single most important predictor of wetland
   conversion in this area, entraining other conversion processes, and that
   spatial patterns of wetland loss could consistently be predicted from
   landscape-level variables. Areas with highest probabilities of
   conversion were found in the most accessible, non-protected regions of
   the landscape. While Palo Verde National Park made a substantial
   contribution to wetland conservation, our results highlight the
   dependence of lower-lying protected areas on upland processes, adding a
   little-addressed dimension of complexity to the dialogue about protected
   area management. Conservation strategies aimed at reducing wetland loss
   in tropical habitats will benefit from careful analysis of the dominant
   land use system(s) at a relatively broad scale, and the subsequent
   development of management and policy res ponses that take into account
   dynamic opportunities and constraints in the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton were evaluated in Lakes Amapa and
   Pirapora, small oxbows in the floodplain of Rio Acre, a tributary of the
   Amazon River in western Brazil. The two lakes differ primarily in their
   degree of connectivity to the main river channel, with the younger Lake
   Pirapora maintaining a connection year-round and displaying physical and
   chemical characteristics responding to rising river water levels, versus
   the older Lake Amapa connecting to file river only during a 2-3 month
   flooding phase and having a distinct period of isolation at the end of
   the dry season. The phytoplankton of Lake Pirapora has a low numeric
   density year-round and is dominated by small C-strategists
   (cryptomonads). The phytoplankton of Lake Amapa has a similar low
   density when the lake is connected to the river. However, once that lake
   is isolated and turbidity declines, density increases an order of
   magnitude and the assemblage becomes dominated by filamentous N-fixing
   Aphanizomenon tropicalis. Coincidentally concentrations of dissolved
   oxygen increase and levels of TN decline, similar to changes during
   autogenic Succession in temperate shallow takes. The seasonal changes in
   phytoplankton of Lake Amapa, from the little it is connected to the time
   when it is isolated from the river, generally conform to the C-S-R

Abstract = {{1. Invasive species are present worldwide, yet predicting which invasive
   species will become problematic in which ecosystems remains an important
   ecological challenge. Floodplains are at particular risk for invasion,
   especially when subjected to anthropogenic disturbance.
   2. We examined how components of flood regime, habitat quality and
   habitat configuration influenced the presence and abundance of three
   invasive shrubs in the floodplain of the Wisconsin River. Shrub taxa
   included two non-natives (Lonicera spp. and Rhamnus spp.) and one native
   (Zanthoxylum americanum). Observations of taxa presence and abundance
   were recorded in nine forested river reaches, spanning three
   physiographic regions. We also compared the productivity of Z.
   americanum across a flood control levee in one reach.
   3. Physiographic region significantly predicted the presence and
   abundance of these three taxa, acting as a synthetic indicator of
   differences in climate, geography and topography. Invasion was greatest
   in regions where modifications to flood regime and land use were most
   pronounced. Physiographic region was excluded from subsequent analyses
   to assess more specific predictors of shrub distributions.
   4. Habitat configuration and quality both predicted shrub taxa presence
   and abundance. Shrub taxa were most frequently observed and most
   abundant in small forest patches, near roads, and in sandy soil with low
   nutrient content. Edge habitats have many of these characteristics.
   Edges appear to be favoured by avian shrub dispersers and provide
   conditions suitable for invasive establishment.
   5. Flooding influenced non-native and native invaders differently.
   Non-native taxa were observed less frequently and at lower abundances in
   frequently flooded areas, probably because of a sensitivity to flooding.
   However, the presence, abundance and productivity of the native invader
   increased with flooding. Anthropogenic modifications to the flood regime
   limited hydrologic connectivity and may have reduced the competitive
   advantage of flood-tolerant traits, which allowed the invasion of upland
   species.
   6. Synthesis. In the floodplain of the Wisconsin River, anthropogenic
   modifications that created edge habitat and altered flood regime
   facilitated shrub invasions, whereas unfragmented forest and intact
   flood regime limited invasion. Large patches of floodplain forest, less
   regulated flooding regimes, and lower road densities may help reduce the
   spread of invasive shrubs in temperate floodplains.}},

Abstract = {{Fish populations in the Brazos River, Texas, were surveyed monthly for 2
   years to determine the relative influence of hydrology and habitat
   characteristics on the recruitment dynamics of seven species
   representing three divergent life history strategies. Surveys were
   conducted in two oxbow lakes with different flood recurrence intervals
   and the main river channel. The first year was relatively dry with few
   oxbow-river connections, whereas year 2 was relatively wet and
   connections between the main channel and floodplain habitats were
   common. Oxbow lakes supported greater juvenile abundances of most
   species relative to the main channel and were particularly important for
   nest building species with parental care. The river channel supported
   small species with extended reproductive periods and large, long-lived
   species that are able to store reproductive potential during sub-optimal
   periods. Hydrologic isolation was associated with greater rotifer
   densities in oxbows, and species with the greatest fecundity produced
   strong year classes during this period. Hydrologic connectivity did not
   increase juvenile production for most species, suggesting that
   recruitment dynamics in the Brazos River are similar to predictions of
   the low flow recruitment hypothesis (LFR). These results suggest that
   both hydrology and habitat heterogeneity interact with fish life history
   strategy to determine optimal conditions for recruitment and all three
   factors must be considered in restoration strategies for floodplain

Abstract = {{This review article describes vectors for nitrogen and phosphorus
   delivery to riparian zones in semiarid African savannas, the processing
   of nutrients in the riparian zone and the effect of disturbance on these
   processes. Semiarid savannas exhibit sharp seasonality, complex
   hillslope hydrology and high spatial heterogeneity, all of which
   ultimately impact nutrient fluxes between riparian, upland and aquatic
   environments. Our review shows that strong environmental drivers such as
   fire and herbivory enhance nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment transport
   to lower slope positions by shaping vegetative patterns. These vectors
   differ significantly from other and and semiarid ecosystems, and from
   mesic ecosystems where the impact of fire and herbivory are less
   pronounced and less predictable. Also unique is the presence of sodic
   soils in certain hillslopes, which substantially alters hydrological
   flowpaths and may act as a trap where nitrogen is immobilized while
   sediment and phosphorus transport is enhanced. Nutrients and sediments
   are also deposited in the riparian zone during seasonal, intermittent
   floods while, during the dry season, subsurface movement of water from
   the stream into riparian soils and vegetation further enrich riparian
   zones with nutrients. As is found in mesic ecosystems, nutrients are
   immobilized in semiarid riparian corridors through microbial and plant
   uptake, whereas dissimilatory processes such as denitrification may be
   important where labile nitrogen and carbon are in adequate supply and
   physical conditions are suitable-such as in seeps, wallows created by
   animals, ephemeral wetlands and stream edges. Interaction between
   temporal hydrologic connectivity and spatial heterogeneity are disrupted
   by disturbances such as large floods and extended droughts, which may
   convert certain riparian patches from sinks to sources for nitrogen and
   phosphorus. In the face of increasing anthropogenic pressure, the
   scientific challenges are to provide a basic understanding of riparian
   biogeochemistry in semiarid African savannas to adequately address the
   temporal and spatial impact of disturbances, and to apply this knowledge
   to better regional land and water management. An integrated,

   organization of shallow soil moisture and hydrologic connectivity.
   However, much of the analysis of the role of soil moisture organization
   and connectivity has been performed in small rangeland catchments.
   Therefore, we examined the relationship between hydrologic connectivity
   and runoff response within a temperate forested watershed of moderate
   relief. We have undertaken spatial surveys of shallow soil moisture over
   a sequence of storms with varying antecedent moisture conditions. We
   analyse each survey for evidence of hydrologic connectivity and we
   monitor the storm response from the catchment outlet. Our results show
   evidence of a non-linear response in runoff generation over small
   changes in measures of antecedent moisture conditions; yet, unlike the
   previous studies of rangeland catchments, in this forested landscape we
   do not observe a significant change in geostatistical hydrologic
   connectivity with variations in antecedent moisture conditions. These
   results suggest that a priori spatial patterns in shallow soil moisture
   in forested terrains may not always be a good predictor of critical
   hydrologic connectivity that leads to threshold change in runoff
   generation, as has been the case in rangeland catchments. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to evaluate pattern of the aquatic macrophyte
   species distribution along the Danube fluvial corridor in Slovakia, and
   to identify the impact of environmental abiotic parameters on macrophyte
   species diversity. Field sampling was performed in the period 1999-2005
   from the boat. Aquatic habitats were divided into 365 survey unit (SU).
   The survey of aquatic macrophytes and abiotic parameters followed the
   European standard approach EN 144184 2003. The plant mass estimate (PME
   - a semi-quantitative estimation of the amount of individual species in
   a SU, which takes into account three-dimensional development of plant
   stands) was estimated according to a five-point-scale in each SU;
   environmental pattern, were assessed over six abiotic parameters (river
   kin, bank type, sediment type, flow velocity class, land-use type, and
   heavily man-modified water bodies). Altogether, four hydrologic
   connectivity types of aquatic habitats were distinguished: the Danube
   River, Open Arms, Separated Arms, and Seepage Water-bodies.
   In total, 54 aquatic macrophytes were recorded for the whole data set of
   the Danube fluvial corridor. The PME data of true aquatic macrophytes
   and the length of SUs created a basis for numerical derivates, relative
   plant mass (RPM), mean mass indices (MMT, MMO) and the distribution
   ratio (d).
   The results correspond with comparable studies on this topic: the
   highest macrophytes species diversity occurred in Separated Arms. On the
   contrary, macrophytes had the lowest richness in the Danube River main
   channel, although their diversity was slightly higher in heavily
   man-modified water bodies (such as the hydropower plant's reservoir and
   the abandoned main channel of the so-called Old Danube). Our results
   suggest that the lateral connectivity types of the river water bodies,
   primarily characterised by different hydrologic dynamics and human
   impact expressed as land-use types are responsible for the variability
   of aquatic macrophyte assemblages along the Danube corridor in Slovakia.

Abstract = {{Water source and lake landscape position can strongly influence the
   physico-chemical characteristics of flowing waters over space and time.
   We examined the physico-chemical heterogeneity in surface waters of an
   alpine stream-lake network (>2600 m a.s.l.) in Switzerland. The
   catchment comprises two basins interspersed with 26 cirque lakes. The
   larger lakes in each basin are interconnected by streams that converge
   in a lowermost lake with an outlet stream. The north basin is primarily
   fed by precipitation and groundwater, whereas the south basin is fed
   mostly by glacial melt from rock glaciers. Surface flow of the entire
   channel network contracted by similar to 60\% in early autumn, when
   snowmelt runoff ceased and cold temperatures reduced glacial outputs,
   particularly in the south basin. Average water temperatures were similar
   to 4 degrees C cooler in the south basin, and temperatures increased by
   about 4-6 degrees C along the longitudinal gradient within each basin.
   Although overall water conductivity was low (<27 mu S cm(-1)) because of
   bedrock geology (ortho-gneiss), the south basin had two times higher
   conductivity values than the north basin. Phosphate-phosphorus levels
   were below analytical detection limits, but particulate phosphorus was
   about four times higher in the north basin (seasonal average: 9 mu g
   1(-1)) than in the south basin (seasonal average: 2 mu g 1(-1)).
   Dissolved nitrogen constituents were around two times higher in the
   south basin than in the north basin, with highest values averaging >300
   mu g 1(-1) (nitrite + nitrate-nitrogen), whereas particulate nitrogen
   was approximately nine times greater in the north basin (seasonal
   average: 97 mu g 1(-1)) than in the south basin (seasonal average: 12 mu
   g 1(-1)). Total inorganic carbon was low (usually <0.8 mg 1(-1)). silica
   was sufficient for algal growth, and particulate organic carbon was 4.5
   times higher in the north basin (average: 0.9 mg 1(-1)) than in the
   south basin (average: 0.2 mg 1(-1)). North-basin streams showed strong
   seasonality in turbidity, particulate-nitrogen and -phosphorus, and
   particulate organic carbon, whereas strong seasonality in south-basin
   streams was observed in conductivity and dissolved nitrogen. Lake
   position influenced the seasonal dynamics in stream temperatures and
   nutrients, particularly in the groundwater/precipitation-fed north-basin
   network. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   of aquatic ecosystem fragmentation on trophic ecology of a resilient,
   dominant, top predator. We demonstrate collapse in trophic niche width
   of the predator in fragmented systems, a phenomenon related to
   significant reductions in diversity of potential prey taxa. Collapsed
   niche width reflects a homogenization of energy flow pathways to top
   predators, likely serving to destabilize remnant food webs and render
   apparently resilient top predators more susceptible to extinction

Abstract = {{Hydrologic flow paths control transport, and therefore are a major
   constraint on the cycling and availability of nutrients within stream
   ecosystems. This control is particularly evident in semiarid streams,
   where hydrologic connectivity between stream, riparian, and upland
   systems increases greatly during storms in the rainy season. We measured
   chloride concentrations in base flow, precipitation, soil water, and
   stream water to quantify the hydrologic connectivity and solute flux
   between soil water, groundwater, and the stream channel during six
   summer floods in 2001 (a wet year; 25 cm winter rain) and 2002 (a dry
   year; 5 cm winter rain) in the San Pedro River, southeastern Arizona.
   This hydrologic information was used to evaluate observed patterns in
   nitrate, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) concentrations in floods. The first floods of each year showed
   increased stream nitrate concentration that was approximately two orders
   of magnitude higher than base flow concentration. DOC consistently
   doubled to tripled during storm events, while DON in 2001 showed no
   response and showed a marked increase in 2002. A chloride mixing model
   indicated that soil and groundwater contributions to storm water
   discharge were related to antecedent conditions and to flood magnitude.
   Soil and groundwater contributions were the highest early in the 2001
   monsoon season following the wet winter, much lower early in 2002
   following a dry winter, and lowest during the largest floods of the 2002
   monsoon season when flows were derived primarily from precipitation and
   overland flow. Stream water nitrate-N concentrations during floods were
   consistently 0.2-0.5 mg/L higher in 2002 than during 2001, suggesting
   greater over-winter accumulation of soil nitrate during the drier year.
   This result is consistent with higher mean nitrate-N concentrations in
   soil water of the riparian zone in 2002 (3.1 mg/L) than in 2001 (0.56
   mg/L). These data highlight the importance of seasonal and interannual
   variability of hydrology in semiarid regions, and the role of water
   availability in driving patterns of soil nutrient accumulation and their
   transport to the stream.}},

Abstract = {{North America harbors an astounding proportion of the world's freshwater
   species, but it is facing a freshwater biodiversity crisis. A first step
   to slowing the loss of biodiversity involves identifying gaps in
   existing efforts to conserve biodiversity and prioritizing opportunities
   to fill these gaps. In this monograph we detail two separate, but
   complementary, conservation planning efforts-a Gap Analysis (GAP) and a
   State Wildlife Action Plan (WAP)-for Missouri that address this first
   step. The goal of the Missouri Aquatic GAP Project was to identify
   riverine ecosystems, habitats, and species not adequately represented
   (i.e., gaps) within existing conservation lands. The goal of the
   freshwater component of the Missouri Wildlife Action Plan was to
   identify and map a set of conservation-opportunity areas (COAs) that
   holistically represent all riverine ecosystems, habitats, and species in
   Missouri. Since conservation planning is a geographical exercise, both
   efforts utilized geographic information systems (GIS). Four principal
   GIS data sets were used in each planning effort: (1) a hierarchical
   riverine ecosystem classification, (2) predicted species distributions,
   (3) public ownership/stewardship, and (4) a human-threat index. Results
   of the gap analyses are not encouraging. Forty five, mostly rare,
   threatened, or endangered, species are not represented in lands set
   aside for conserving biodiversity. Results also illustrate the
   fragmented nature of conservation lands, which are mainly situated in
   the uplands and fail to provide connectivity among riverine habitats.
   Furthermore, many conservation lands are severely threatened by an array
   of human disturbances. In contrast, results of the WAP provide hope that
   relatively intact riverine ecosystems still exist. A total of 158 COAs,
   representing similar to 6\% of the total kilometers of stream in
   Missouri, were selected for the WAR This illustrates that a wide
   spectrum of biodiversity can be represented within a small portion of
   the total resource base, but the area of conservation concern is often
   much larger. Identifying priority riverscapes for conservation is an
   important first step toward effective biodiversity conservation. Yet,
   achieving the ultimate goal of conserving biodiversity will require
   vigilance on the part of all responsible parties, with particular
   attention to addressing and coordinating the many remaining logistical
   tasks.}},

   74 watersheds intersecting or within the national forest boundary. Five
   of the six clusters have predominantly high gradient streams and runoff
   dominated by snowmelt or mixed snowmelt and rainfall. Most watersheds on
   the Bighorn National Forest are sensitive to alterations in water supply

Abstract = {{We performed synoptic sampling of a 95-km reach of the San Pedro River,

   long. Upper and lower reaches were characterized by areas of localized
   groundwater input followed by downstream evapo-concentration gradients,
   limited downstream solute transport, and highly variable carbon and

   During the monsoon season, base flow discharge increased five-to
   ten-fold, dissolved organic matter and inorganic N increased two- to
   ten-fold, Fluorescence Index (FI) values indicated a large input of
   terrestrial solutes, and both chloride concentrations and delta(18)O
   values indicated that stream water and alluvial groundwater were well

   exhibited continuous hydrologic connectivity during the nonmonsoon
   season was a net sink for N, while the reaches characterized by limited

   Biomass values were multiplied by in situ or published growth rates to

   Secondary production estimates are a useful way to measure responses of

Abstract = {{Cumulatively, headwater streams contribute to maintaining hydrologic
   connectivity and ecosystem integrity at regional scales. Hydrologic
   connectivity is the water-mediated transport of matter, energy and
   organisms within or between elements of the hydrologic cycle. Headwater
   streams compose over two-thirds of total stream length in a typical
   river drainage and directly connect the upland and riparian landscape to
   the rest of the stream ecosystem. Altering headwater streams, e.g., by
   channelization, diversion through pipes, impoundment and burial,
   modifies fluxes between uplands and downstream river segments and
   eliminates distinctive habitats. The large-scale ecological effects of
   altering headwaters are amplified by land uses that alter runoff and
   nutrient loads to streams, and by widespread dam construction on larger
   rivers (which frequently leaves free-flowing upstream portions of river
   systems essential to sustaining aquatic biodiversity). We discuss three
   examples of large-scale consequences of cumulative headwater alteration.
   Downstream eutrophication and coastal hypoxia result, in part, from
   agricultural practices that alter headwaters and wetlands while
   increasing nutrient runoff. Extensive headwater alteration is also
   expected to lower secondary productivity of river systems by reducing
   stream-system length and trophic subsidies to downstream river segments,
   affecting aquatic communities and terrestrial wildlife that utilize
   aquatic resources. Reduced viability of freshwater biota may occur with
   cumulative headwater alteration, including for species that occupy a
   range of stream sizes but for which headwater streams diversify the
   network of interconnected populations or enhance survival for particular
   life stages. Developing a more predictive understanding of ecological
   patterns that may emerge on regional scales as a result of headwater
   alterations will require studies focused on components and pathways that
   connect headwaters to river, coastal and terrestrial ecosystems.
   Linkages between headwaters and downstream ecosystems cannot be
   discounted when addressing large-scale issues such as hypoxia in the
   Gulf of Mexico and global losses of biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Vallisneria spinulosa is a dominant submerged macrophyte in lakes of the
   middle-lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Allozyme variation, clonal
   diversity and population genetic structure were investigated for a total
   of 396 individuals sampled from 10 extant populations. V spinulosa
   maintained high levels of genetic variation both at the species (P =
   46.2 A = 1.69, H-e = 0.23) and at the population level (P = 46.2, A =
   1.58, H-e = 0.21). Although aquatic macrophytes commonly exhibit low
   genetic variation within populations, the obligately outcrossing mating
   system of V spinulosa and pervasive gene flow likely account for the
   high levels of diversity maintained within populations. All V spinulosa
   populations contained high clonal diversity with a mean proportion of
   distinguishable genotypes of 0.57 and a mean Simpson's diversity index
   of 0.95, indicating that populations were founded sexually or that
   successful seedling recruitment occurred after initial colonization.
   Partitioning of genetic diversity revealed a surprisingly low population
   differentiation (G(ST) = 0.06) as compared to other hydrophilous
   angiosperms. No evidence of isolation-by-distance was found (r = 0.056,
   P = 0.312), suggesting that gene flow was not restricted geographically.
   The UPGMA cluster analysis revealed that several widely separated
   populations grouped together, suggesting long-distance gene flow among
   populations. The high vagility of V spinulosa and extensive hydrologic
   connectivity among populations have facilitated long-distance gene flow
   and resulted in the pattern of population genetic structure in V
   spinulosa. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Human impacts to aquatic ecosystems often involve changes in hydrologic

   bivariate plots to visualize human impacts and restoration efforts in
   terms of connectivity and flow dynamics. Human-induced changes in
   longitudinal, lateral, and vertical connectivity are often accompanied
   by changes in flow dynamics, but in our experience restoration efforts
   to date have more often restored connectivity than flow dynamics.
   Restoration actions have included removing dams to restore fish passage,
   reconnecting flow through artificially cut-off side channels, setting
   back or breaching levees, and removing fine sediment deposits that block
   vertical exchange with the bed, thereby partially restoring hydrologic
   connectivity, i.e., longitudinal, lateral, or vertical. Restorations
   have less commonly affected flow dynamics, presumably because of the
   social and economic importance of water diversions or flood control.
   Thus, as illustrated in these bivariate plots, the trajectories of
   ecological restoration are rarely parallel with degradation trajectories
   because restoration is politically and economically easier along some

Abstract = {{Historical records indicate that gray wolves (Canis lupus) were
   extirpated from the upper Gallatin River Basin in the early 1900s.
   Following the removal of these large carnivores, elk (Cervis elaphus)
   began to increasingly browse streamside vegetation in the winter range,
   causing widespread loss of formerly extensive willow (Salix spp.)
   communities. Historical aerial photographs and chronosequences of ground
   photographs were used to characterize general changes in vegetation and
   channel morphology over time. In August of 2004, riparian vegetation and
   channel cross-sections were surveyed along three reaches of the upper
   Gallatin River. Reach A was located upstream of the elk winter range
   (control reach) whereas reaches B and C (treatment reaches) were located
   within the elk winter range. Willow cover on floodplains averaged 85 per
   cent for reach A, but only 26 per cent and 5 per cent for reaches B and
   C, respectively. The average return period of calculated bankfull
   discharges was 3.1 yrs for reach A but increased to 32.4 yrs and 10.6
   yrs for reaches B and C, respectively. The long-term loss of streamside
   vegetation allowed channels to generally increase in hydraulic capacity
   (via increases in width, incision or both) and decrease their hydrologic
   connectivity with adjacent floodplains. This study documents, perhaps
   for the first time, the resultant impacts to riparian vegetation

Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{After decades of research, the timing and nature of Late Miocene
   connections between the Mediterranean, Paratethys and the global ocean
   are still speculative. The hydrologic flux implications of exchange or
   isolation are central to all hypotheses for generating the major
   lithological changes that represent the Messinian Salinity Crisis.
   Moreover, differences in the hydrologic fluxes envisaged are the primary
   distinction between models. Despite this, these fluxes remain largely
   unconstrained. This paper describes the basis for using Sr isotope data
   innovatively combined with salinity data through hydrologic budget
   modelling to determine the timing and nature of Mediterranean hydrologic
   connectivity. We examine the hypotheses for three Late Miocene events to
   illustrate how this approach allows us to test implied hydrologic
   scenarios and exclude incompatible models. 1) Pre-evaporite restriction
   of the Mediterranean; 2) the initiation of salt precipitation; 3)
   connection between the Sea of Marmara and both Paratethys and the
   Mediterranean during the Messinian. This process suggests that the
   Atlantic-Mediterranean exchange was significantly reduced up to three
   million years before evaporite precipitation. It also indicates that
   end-member hypotheses for initiating salt precipitation in the
   Mediterranean (desiccation and connected basin models) are inconsistent
   with Sr isotope data. A contrasting model where evaporite formation was
   triggered by Atlantic transgression into a strongly
   evaporation-dominated Mediterranean is shown to be more compatible with
   available datasets. The application to Sea of Marmara samples indicates
   that salinity changes in the basin were not caused by changes to the
   amount of inflow from either Paratethys or the Mediterranean. Other
   possible as yet untested applications important for constraining
   different aspects of the Messinian Salinity Crisis are highlighted. (c)

Abstract = {{Although historic land use is widely recognized as an important
   determinant of watershed N cycling, efforts to examine land use legacy
   effects are limited by incomplete historical data. This research
   evaluates N isotopes of sedimented organic matter (delta N-15(org)), in
   a palynological context, as a long-term proxy of changes in N source to
   wetland biota. N and S isotope measurements of organic sediments, fossil
   plant fragments, and living plants are used to explore isotope
   stratigraphies of wetland sediment cores. Processes potentially
   contributing to isotope stratigraphies are investigated including the
   following: a change in N source, diagenesis, and denitrification. We
   document the delta N-15(org) stratigraphy of a core from the Smithsonian
   Environmental Research Center, MD, U.S.A. spans approximately 350 years,
   during which time delta N-15(org) increases from +2 parts per thousand
   to +7 parts per thousand. Reconstructed population density and
   wastewater inputs to the watershed suggest that the increase in delta
   N-15 reflects changing land use from forested conditions to increasing
   nutrient inputs from human waste. Our results illustrate the importance
   of hydrologic connectivity in delivering waste-derived N in a watershed
   characterized by relatively low human population density. These results
   also demonstrate how this approach can expand the temporal horizon over

Abstract = {{This study examined the influence of fall-spawning coho salmon
   (Oncorhynchus kisutch) on the density, growth rate, body condition, and
   survival to outmigration of juvenile coho salmon on the Copper River
   Delta, Alaska, USA. During the fall of 1999 and 2000, fish rearing in
   beaver ponds that received spawning salmon were compared with fish from
   ponds that did not receive spawners and also with fish from ponds that
   were artificially enriched with salmon carcasses and eggs. The response
   to spawning salmon was variable. In some ponds, fall-spawning salmon
   increased growth rates and improved the condition of juvenile coho
   salmon. The enrichment with salmon carcasses and eggs significantly
   increased growth rates of fish in nonspawning ponds. However, there was
   little evidence that the short-term growth benefits observed in the fall
   led to greater overwinter growth or survival to outmigration when
   compared with fish from the nonspawning ponds. One potential reason for
   this result may be that nutrients from spawning salmon are widely
   distributed across the delta because of hydrologic connectivity and
   hyporheic flows. The relationship among spawning salmon, overwinter
   growth, and smolt production on the Copper River Delta does not appear
   to be limited entirely to a simple positive feedback loop.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrologic dynamics are examined across it range of spatial scales in a
   78 km(2) wetland-dominated drainage basin in south central Ontario,
   Canada. The basin typically receives similar to 800 min of precipitation
   annually (similar to 20\% as snowfall), although precipitation during
   the 1998 study year was 28\% greater due to increased snowfall. Water
   table elevation, outlet stream discharge and local groundwater flow
   patterns were monitored in a representative interdrumlin headwater
   wetland sub-basin. A rising water table during snowmelt sustained
   surface saturation in the wetland and at the slope-wetland interface,
   and saturation overland flow generated the bulk of annual runoff,
   Despite considerable till thickness on the drumlin slopes, minor
   groundwater fluxes from slopes to the wetland could not maintain
   near-surface water tables. These fell below the ground surface shortly
   after snowmelt and led to cessation of stream flow. Vertical water
   movement in response to precipitation, evapotranspiration and recharge
   of deeper groundwater was more important than lateral groundwater fluxes
   in explaining the wetland's hydrologic behavior. Spatial and temporal
   dynamics of variable runoff source areas in the basin were examined
   based on stream flow response from 15 headwater wetland sub-basins. Peak
   basin stream flow resulted from delivery of sub-basins runoff to a
   spatially linked drainage network during spring snowmelt. However,
   sub-basins became decoupled front the basin Outlet as summer progressed,
   and their runoff during Significant Summer and fall storms entered
   ephemeral stream channels where most was lost to evaporation and
   infiltration or held in surface storage. Nevertheless, hydrologic
   connectivity was more protracted in 1998 than would be likely during a
   `normal' precipitation year. Hydrologic processes in this drumlinized
   landscape are inconsistent with some aspects of the variable source area
   concept of stream flow generation, and caution should be used when
   extrapolating knowledge and models from well-integrated drainage
   networks to wetland-dominated basins such its that examined here. (C)

   Simulations of the model with varying levels of connectivity and in the
   presence and absence of chemotherapy control were run for 227 villages

   either increase or decrease with connectivity, depending on the degree

Abstract = {{Drought leads to a loss of longitudinal and lateral hydrologic
   connectivity, which causes direct or indirect changes in stream
   ecosystem properties. Changes in macrohabitat availability from a
   riffle-pool sequence to isolated pools are among the most conspicuous
   consequences of connectivity loss. Macroinvertebrate assemblages were
   compared among 3 distinct stream macrohabitats (riffles {[}R], pools
   connected to riffles {[}Pc], disconnected pools {[}Pd]) of 19
   Mediterranean-climate sites in northern California to examine the
   influence of loss of habitat resulting from drought disturbance. At the
   time of sampling, 10 sites were perennial and included R and Pc
   macrohabitats, whereas 9 sites were intermittent and included only Pd
   macrohabitats. Taxa richness was more variable in Pd, and taxa richness
   was significantly lower in Pd than in Pc but not R. These results
   suggested a decline in richness between Pc and Pd that might be
   associated with loss of connectivity. Lower Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera,
   and Trichoptera (EPT) richness relative to Odonata, Coleoptera, and
   Heteroptera (OCH) richness was observed for Pd than R and Pc
   macrohabitats. Family composition was more similar between R and Pc than
   between R or Pc and Pd macrohabitats. This similarity may be associated
   with greater connectivity between R and Pc macrohabitats. Correspondence
   analysis indicated that macroinvertebrate composition changed along a
   gradient from R to Pc and Pd that was related to a
   perennial-intermittent gradient across sites. High variability among
   macroinvertebrate assemblages in Pd could have been related to
   variability in the duration of intermittency. In cluster analysis,
   macroinvertebrate assemblages were grouped by macrohabitat first and
   then by site, suggesting that the macrohabitat filter had a greater
   influence on macroinvertebrate assemblages than did local site
   characteristics. Few taxa were found exclusively in Pc, and this
   macrohabitat shared numerous taxa with R and Pd, indicating that Pc may
   act as a bridge between R and Pd during drought. Drought is regarded as
   a ramp disturbance, but our results suggest that the response of
   macroinvertebrate assemblages to the loss of hydrological connectivity
   among macrohabitats is gradual, at least in Mediterranean-climate
   streams where drying is gradual. However, the changes may be more
   dramatic in and and semiarid streams or in Mediterranean-climate streams

Abstract = {{To improve our understanding of lake landscape position, we compared

   lake surface hydrologic position, (2) ``lake order,{''} which measures
   connections to streams by stream order, (3) `` lake network number,{''}
   which measures connections to other lakes, and (4) ``lake network

   lakes (in a chain or branched). We sampled 71 lakes in northern
   Michigan, U.S.A. and measured lake landscape position and landscape
   characteristics around each lake (e.g., land use/cover and geology) to
   answer two questions: (1) which metric of landscape position explains
   the most variation in lake water chemistry/clarity? and (2) what
   landscape and physical features are also related to landscape position?
   All four landscape position metrics explained significant variation in
   some water chemistry/clarity variables. However, lake order, the metric
   based on stream order, consistently explained the most variation,
   ranging from 22\% (dissolved organic carbon) to 53\% (conductivity and
   calcium), with lake hydrology, the metric based on both streams and
   lakes, explaining similar amounts of variation to lake order, but less

Abstract = {{This work presents the details of a focused field experiment carried out
   to understand the coupled processes of runoff generation and
   biogeochemical cycling in an agricultural catchment in Western
   Australia, with a particular focus on NO3- cycling and transport.
   Detailed hydrometric, chemical, and geochemical data corresponding to a
   shallow perched aquifer along a topo-sequence in the hillslope helped
   identify the existence of two hydrologically and chemically distinct
   landscape units, i.e., upland and riparian zones. Riparian zones control
   the catchment storm response while upland zones can be considered as
   storage units, controlling the base flow component of streamflow. The
   biogeochemical role and functioning of these landscape units are also
   clear. Upland zones constitute the sources of NO3- and participate in
   down-slope transport, while riparian areas act as sinks for NO3- and are
   responsible for its depletion. The experimental results highlighted the
   critical role of the shallow perched aquifer whose space-time dynamics
   governed the periodic connection and disconnection between riparian and
   upland zones, which have a significant impact on the catchment's
   hydrological and hydrochemical responses. The role of topography was
   also highlighted, as different mechanisms of NO3- attenuation in the
   riparian zones are possible depending on the steepness of the hillslope,
   with differences in slope leading to different velocities and flow rates
   and impacting on relative dominance of the different mechanisms of NO3-
   depletion. These detailed analyses have helped us to develop a
   ``unifying perceptual model{''} of the coupled hydrological and
   biogeochemical response of Susannah Brook catchment, which will advance
   our ability to generalize these results to other hillslopes, and
   eventually to other catchments in the region. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Three oxbow lakes with different connection frequencies and an adjacent
   reach of the middle Brazos River, Texas, were surveyed quarterly from
   summer 1993 to summer 1996 to examine the effects of hydrology and
   physicochemical attributes on fish assemblage structure. During flood
   events, oxbows usually were colonized by about 20 fish species from the
   river channel, and several fluvial specialists were rarely or never
   sampled from oxbows. Multivariate analyses of seine samples revealed
   divergent patterns of assemblage structure during periods of isolation
   that also were associated with a gradient of maximum water depth,
   temperature, and conductivity. In contrast, analysis of gill-net samples
   that targeted large fishes revealed low between-site and temporal
   variation in assemblage structure among oxbow lakes but significant
   differences in the structure of oxbow versus channel assemblages. The
   shallowest oxbow (which dried out with greatest frequency) had the most
   variable fish assemblage across seasons and was dominated by small
   colonizing species, whereas deeper oxbows and the river channel tended
   to have higher species richness and more stable assemblages. Despite
   large differences in connection frequency and distance from the river
   channel, the deepest oxbows had the most similar fish assemblage
   structure across all seasons. Multiple regression analysis suggested
   that the timing and frequency of flood events (yielding colonization) in
   the most frequently connected oxbow interact with predator abundance
   (yielding mortality) to influence the abundance of common lotic-adapted
   minnows (red shiner Cyprinella lutrensis and bullhead minnow Pimephales
   vigilax) that periodically dominated the species assemblage of that
   oxbow after floods. Our results suggest that current hydrologic and
   geomorphologic dynamics in the middle Brazos River produce oxbow lakes
   with a range of physical characteristics yielding different disturbance
   and colonization regimes that strongly influence fish species
   assemblages.}},

Abstract = {{A holistic approach to fisheries management requires an understanding of

   geographic information systems to extract data describing habitat
   influences across three different spatial scales for a selected
   ecological class of Minnesota bass-panfish lakes (n = 113). These data
   were then analyzed by regression tree analysis to describe relationships
   between habitat and trap-net catch per effort (CPE) of bluegills Lepomis
   macrochirus. At the landscape scale of analysis, bluegill CPE increased
   among lakes with decreases in hydrologic connectivity (landscape
   position) and increases in geographic northing and easting gradients
   that corresponded to regional differences in geomorphology and edaphic
   characteristics. At the watershed-lake scale of analysis, a regression
   tree model with variables describing watershed area, cultivated land
   cover, forested land cover, and lake area explained 55\% of the
   variation in bluegill CPE among lakes. At the site scale, a regression
   tree model with variables describing submerged plant cover and detritus
   substrates explained 57\% of the variation in bluegill CPE among 72
   sites spread among six lakes. However, much of the site-scale habitat
   influences on bluegill abundance was explained by broader landscape- and

Abstract = {{1. The hydrologic connectivity between landscape elements and streams

   2. The occurrence of koaro (Galaxias brevipinnis) in 50-m stream reaches
   with either forested or non-forested riparian margins at 172 sites in 24
   catchments on Banks Peninsula, South Island, New Zealand was analysed.
   Proportions of catchments forested and the dominant position (upland or
   lowland) of forest within catchments were determined using geographical
   information system spatial analysis tools.
   3. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated forest position and
   proportion forested at the catchment accounted for the majority of the
   variation in the overall proportion of sites in a catchment with koaro.
   4. Where forest was predominantly in the lower part of the catchments,
   the presence of riparian cover was important in explaining the
   proportion of sites with koaro. However, where forest was predominantly
   in the upper part of the catchment, the effect of riparian forest was
   not as strong. In the absence of riparian forest cover, no patterns of

Abstract = {{Most forestry systems use extensive unsealed road networks for timber
   harvesting and other forest management activities. These forest roads
   are significant sources of runoff and sediment to streams, causing
   impacts on the quantity and quality of stream water.
   The impact of unsealed forest road networks on stream water quality has
   long been recognised and documented by many researchers (e. g. Takken et
   al., 2005; Flanagan et al., 2003; Croke and Mockler, 2001; Megahan et
   al. 2001; Croke et al., 1999; Montgomery, D. R., 1994 and Anderson et
   al. 1976). However, the importance of the degree of road-to-stream
   connectivity has only generated a limited amount of focused research and
   documentation (e. g. Takken et al., 2005; Farabi, 2005; Hairsine et al.,
   2002 and Croke and Mockler, 2001).
   To predict, control and mitigate the negative impacts to stream water
   quality arising from forest roads, it is necessary to understand the
   hydrological connection between the sediment source and the stream.
   Thus, knowing where flow pathways from roads will reach and affect
   stream water quality is important for both managers and researchers.
   This mostly depends on the characteristics of the road layout and of the
   road-to-stream hydrologic connectivity.. The problems occur when this
   connectivity exists and the road-derived runoff with associated
   sediments are delivered to the adjacent streams.
   The overall approach in forest road planning and maintenance is to be
   able to simulate, predict, and remedy or mitigate the impacts of the
   forest road on the elements at risk; in an efficient way. In this study,
   the feasibility of predicting the likelihood of sheet erosion occurrence
   along the road systems and risk of this to the stream water quality were
   explored using selected terrain attributes as indicators.
   The study investigated how the risk to soil erosion and stream water
   deterioration arising from unsealed forest roads can be predicted,
   mapped and highlighted using different GIS techniques, terrain
   attributes and hydrologic models. Several methods were used to carry out
   and evaluate the study. A 10,477 ha forested catchment in the Australian
   Capital Territory (ACT) was used as a case study area for collecting the
   necessary field data.
   The results showed that a small number of variables, such as hillslope
   gradient, Road Contribution Length (RCL), Road Contribution Area (RCA),
   Compound Topographic Index (CTI), Stream Power Index (SPI), drainage
   area and distance were the variables most highly correlated to the
   probability of the erosion occurring on the surface of the roads and at
   the outlet of drainage structures. The results also demonstrated the
   usefulness of GIS in combination with mathematical (algorithm) and
   hydrological models as a method for determining the level of
   road-to-stream connectivity by calculating the flow distance between the
   outlet of drains and streams. A combination of derived and independent
   variables was used to map the final risk assessment. The occurrence of
   problems in the elements at risk (soil and water) was presented as a set
   of grid layers using GIS overlay applications. The final result of this
   study is an integrated methodology for ``Forest Road Impact
   Assessment{''} (FRIA), which uses GIS techniques, terrain attributes and
   hydrologic models to identify likely sources of stream sediment from
   forest roads.}},

Abstract = {{We examined seasonal patterns in macroinvertebrate benthic abundance and

   upper and lower main channel, a side-channel seasonally connected
   upstream to the main channel, and an intermittent side-slope tributary
   and permanent springbrook having no upstream surface connection to the
   main channel. Flow in the main and side-channels was influenced
   seasonally by upstream glaciers, whereas the tributary and springbrook
   had no direct glacial input. Macroinvertebrate assemblages differed
   markedly among streams. Density, biomass, and taxonomic richness
   typically were lowest in the upper main channel and highest in the
   springbrook. Seasonal changes in assemblage composition were more
   pronounced in the main and side-channels than in the tributary and
   springbrook. In the upper main channel, larvae colonizing cages filled
   with natural substrata reflected benthic assemblage structure regardless
   of season and colonizing taxa exhibited a high propensity to drift. In
   contrast, larval colonists differed significantly from benthic
   assemblages in the tributary and springbrook, and colonists were mostly
   from drift. The lower main and side-channels displayed high seasonality
   in colonization dynamics, being related to their hydrologic connectivity
   to other streams that may have provided larval colonists. Benthos to
   drift abundance ratios suggested that the upper main channel represented
   a relatively closed system with little interaction among other streams

   denitrification enzyme activity was highest in backwater lakes and
   lowest in the main channel. Throughout the study reach, highest
   denitrification enzyme activity occurred during fall and lowest occurred
   in winter. Rates during spring floods (2001) were only slightly higher
   than during the preceding winter. Mean unamended denitrification rates
   ranged from 0.02 (fall 2001 in backwaters) to 0.40 mug N.cm(-2.)h(-1)
   (spring 2001 in backwaters). Laboratory experiments showed that
   denitrification rates increased significantly with addition of NO3-
   regardless of sediment C content, while rates increased little with
   addition of labile C (glucose). Denitrification in this reach of the
   upper Mississippi River appears to be NO3- limited throughout the
   growing season and the delivery of NO3- is strongly controlled by river
   discharge and hydrologic connectivity across the floodplain. We estimate
   that denitrification removes 6939 t N.year(-1) or 6.9\% of the total

Abstract = {{Wetlands have been identified as important sites of mercury methylation
   in catchments, but the range of wetland types and their geographic
   distribution for which methylmercury fluxes are reported in the
   literature are limited. Linkages among wetland hydrology, total mercury
   and methylmercury concentrations and fluxes, and other water quality
   parameters were assessed in a temperate forested swamp in Southern
   Ontario, Canada. Two hydrogeomorphically distinct stream reaches within
   the wetland exhibited differences in wetland-stream hydrologic
   connectivity, which strongly influenced mercury dynamics. Total mercury
   flux from both reaches to the downstream was highest during flow
   conditions in which the wetland and stream were hydrologically
   connected. The wetland as a whole was a net sink for total mercury and a
   net source for methylmercury to the downstream system. Both total
   mercury and methylmercury concentrations were related to dissolved and
   particulate organic carbon in stream waters, but these relationships
   were dependent upon the sampling location and flow conditions.
   Throughout the wetland, methylmercury concentrations exhibited temporal
   relationships with sulfate concentrations. Further, despite short
   surface water residence times, periods of wetland and stream disconnect
   and high pH (approx. 8) in surface water, methylmercury fluxes from this
   wetland to the downstream were similar to those from more stagnant and

Abstract = {{Populations of the freshwater mussel genus Anodonta appear to be in a
   state of rapid decline in western North America, following a trend that
   unfortunately seems to be prevalent among these animals (Mollusca:
   Unionoida). Here we describe the patterns of molecular divergence and
   diversity among Anodonta populations in the Bonneville Basin, a large
   sub-basin of the Great Basin in western North America. Using amplified
   fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis, we found a striking lack
   of nuclear diversity within some of these populations, along with a high
   degree of structuring among populations (F-ST 0.61), suggesting
   post-Pleistocene isolation, due either to a long-term loss of hydrologic
   connectivity among populations or to more recent fish introductions. We
   also found evidence of recent hybridization in one of these populations,
   possibly mediated by fish-stocking practices. Using mitochondrial
   sequence data, we compared the Bonneville Basin populations to Anodonta
   in several other drainages in western North America. We found a general
   lack of resolution in these phylogenetic reconstructions, although there
   was a tendency for the Bonneville Basin Anodonta (tentatively A.
   californiensis) to cluster with A. oregonensis from the adjacent
   Lahontan Basin in Nevada. We recommend further investigation of
   anthropogenic factors that may be contributing to the decline of western
   Anodonta and a broad-scale analysis and synthesis of genetic and
   morphological variation among Anodonta in western North America.}},

Abstract = {{We used underwater visual census (UVC) to characterize fish assemblages
   among estuaries with different degrees of fragmentation on Andros
   Island, Bahamas. Estuaries were classified a priori into four
   fragmentation categories: totally fragmented (no surface water
   connectivity to the ocean), partially fragmented, minimally fragmented,
   and unfragmented (unimpeded surface water connectivity through the
   estuary to the ocean). Visual surveys (n=159) were conducted in thirty
   estuarine systems using snorkeling gear in four habitat types: flat,
   mangrove, rock, and seagrass. Fish species density differed
   significantly among habitat types and among estuaries with different
   degrees of fragmentation. Highest species density occurred in rock
   habitats in unfragmented or minimally fragmented estuaries; lowest
   species density was in totally fragmented estuaries. Assemblages in
   unfragmented and minimally fragmented estuaries were characterized by
   presence of reef-associated (e.g., damselfish and parrotfish) and
   transient marine (e.g., jacks) taxa. In completely fragmented sites,
   assemblages were dominated by species tolerant of temperature and
   salinity extremes (e.g., sheepshead minnow). Multi-dimensional scaling
   suggested fish assemblages in mangrove and rock habitats experienced the
   greatest impact of estuary fragmentation (i.e., the most differentiation
   among surveys in estuaries with different fragmentation status). Fish
   assemblages were especially variable among partially fragmented
   estuaries (i.e., estuaries where hydrologic connectivity was maintained
   by a culvert), suggesting hydrologic connectivity through culverts may
   not be sufficient to maintain habitat quality, recruitment dynamics, or
   upstream movements by vagile organisms. These data reveal effects
   fragmentation has on faunal assemblages, and demonstrates that faunal
   presence/absence may guide initiatives to conserve and restore
   sub-tropical estuaries.}},

Journal = {{GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{17}},

Month = {{NOV 22}},
Abstract = {{{[}1] Hydrologic processes control much of the export of organic matter
   and nutrients from the land surface. It is the variability of these
   hydrologic processes that produces variable patterns of nutrient
   transport in both space and time. In this paper, we explore how
   hydrologic ``connectivity'' potentially affects nutrient transport.
   Hydrologic connectivity is defined as the condition by which disparate
   regions on the hillslope are linked via subsurface water flow. We
   present simulations that suggest that for much of the year, water
   draining through a catchment is spatially isolated. Only rarely, during
   storm and snowmelt events when antecedent soil moisture is high, do our
   simulations suggest that mid-slope saturation (or near saturation)
   occurs and that a catchment connects from ridge to valley. Observations
   during snowmelt at a small headwater catchment in Idaho are consistent
   with these model simulations. During early season discharge episodes, in
   which the mid-slope soil column is not saturated, the electrical
   conductivity in the stream remains low, reflecting a restricted, local
   (lower slope) source of stream water and the continued isolation of
   upper and mid-slope soil water and nutrients from the stream system.
   Increased streamflow and higher stream water electrical conductivity,
   presumably reflecting the release of water from the upper reaches of the
   catchment, are simultaneously observed when the mid-slope becomes
   sufficiently wet. This study provides preliminary evidence that the
   seasonal timing of hydrologic connectivity may affect a range of
   ecological processes, including downslope nutrient transport, C/N
   cycling, and biological productivity along the toposequence. A better
   elucidation of hydrologic connectivity will be necessary for
   understanding local processes as well as material export from land to
   water at regional and global scales.}},

Abstract = {{In 2001 and 2002, we pit trapped arthropods at eight riparian forest
   sites along the middle Rio Grande, four characterized by flooding in
   some years (flood sites) and four others where periodic flooding no

   in 2002, while nonflood sites never flooded. Arthropod counts and
   hierarchical cluster analyses of the sites indicated (1) significantly
   greater abundance of carabid beetles and the isopod Porcellio laevis in
   2001 than in 2002; (2) significantly greater carabid beetle abundance at
   flood sites during each year of the study, with the relative abundance
   of one carabid species, Calathus opaculus, significantly higher at
   nonflood sites in 2002; (3) marginally significantly higher (2001) or
   significantly higher (2002) carabid species richness at flood sites; (4)
   no obvious response of the other taxa examined (isopods, tenebrionid

   differences in isopod abundance between flood and nonflood sites
   approached significance in 2001; (5) successful classification of all
   nonflood sites and three flood sites using the Bray-Curtis Similarity

   beetles are fairly sensitive indicators of hydrologic connectivity
   between the Rio Grande and its riparian forest, while the other taxa

Abstract = {{The Nyack flood plain of the Middle Fork Flathead River, MT, USA is a
   9-km anastomosed alluvial montane flood plain. Upstream from the flood
   plain, the river is unregulated and the catchment virtually pristine. A
   patchy mosaic of vegetation and channels exists on the flood-plain
   surface. The surface and subsurface geomorphic structures of the flood
   plain facilitate high hydrologic connectivity (water flux between the
   channel and flood plain) marked by complex seasonal patterns of
   flood-plain inundation, extensive penetration of channel water laterally
   into the alluvial aquifer, and springbrooks formed by ground water
   erupting onto the flood-plain surface. After delineating and classifying
   flood-plain ``elements{''} (vegetation patches and channel reaches) on
   the flood plain, we analyzed field-based elevation survey data to
   identify expected relationships among flood-plain element type, surface
   scour frequency, and flood-plain elevation. Data analyses show that
   scour frequency was inversely proportional to the elevation of the flood
   plain above river stage, except when localized geomorphic controls such
   as natural levees prevent normal high flows from inundating and scouring
   relatively low flood-plain elements. Further, while different
   flood-plain element types occupy distinct elevation zones on the flood
   plain, the elevation of each zone above the river channel varies with
   localized channel entrenchment. We found that topographic variation
   among flood-plain elements is greater than the variation within
   elements, suggesting that coarse-scale flood-plain topography can be
   characterized by delineating flood-plain elements. Field data document
   strong associations between specific classes of flood-plain elements and
   preferential ground-water flow paths in the upper alluvial aquifer.
   Combined with preexisting ground penetrating RADAR (GPR) surveys, these
   data intimate a sinuous lattice of preferential ground-water flow paths
   (buried abandoned streambeds) in the upper alluvial aquifer at
   approximately the same elevation as the main channel's streambed. Using
   aerial photo interpretation and the identified relationships among
   element-types, elevation, and preferential ground-water flow paths, we
   developed a quantitative, three-dimensional characterization of surface
   and subsurface geomorphology across the entire flood plain to support a
   heuristic modeling effort investigating the influence of flood-plain
   geomorphology on spatio-temporal patterns of surface and ground-water
   flow and exchange under dynamic hydrologic regimes. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The relationships among water level, inundated area, and shoreline
   dynamics were investigated in a bar-braided and an island-braided
   floodplain of the Tagliamento River in northeast Italy. Ground-based
   surveys with a differential global positioning system (aGPS) unit were
   used to delineate all aquatic-terrestrial interfaces (shorelines) in the
   active floodplain at different water levels. Despite complex inundation
   patterns, a highly significant (P < 0.00001) linear relationship between
   water level and arcsine square root of inundated area was found in both
   reaches (y = 0.49x + 0.07). A highly significant (P < 0.00009)
   second-order polynomial relationship occurred between water level and
   shoreline length (y = 87.83 - 65.85x(2) + 169.83x). Using these
   relationships as simple predictive models, we converted several years of
   water-level data into predictions for degree of inundation and shoreline
   length. The plot of the simulated degree of inundation strongly
   resembled the actual hydrograph. Complete inundation of the active
   flood-plains occurred one or two times per year; however, the degree of
   inundation at lower water levels was highly dynamic during most of the
   year. Simulated shoreline length averaged 171 m ha(-1) (13.6 km km(-1)),
   with a maximum of 197 In ha(-1) (15.6 km km(-1)) occurring during
   periods with intermediate water levels. The corresponding values
   determined with GPS were somewhat higher, with an average value of 181 m
   ha(-1) (14.4 km km(-1)) and a maximum of 214 m ha(-1) (16.3 km km(-1)).
   During major flood events, actual shoreline length decreased to 28 m
   ha(-1) (2.1 km km(-1)). Braiding index and upstream surface hydrologic
   connectivity were positively related to water level, whereas total area
   of isolated water bodies was negatively related to water level. The
   number of nodes remained high most of the time during the 2-year study

Abstract = {{Intact riparian zones are the product of an incredibly complex multitude
   of linkages between the geomorphic, hydrologic, and biotic features of
   the ecosystem. Land-use activities that sever or alter these linkages

   riparian vegetation and channel morphology by sampling species
   composition and herbaceous root biomass in incised (down-cut and
   widened) versus unincised (intact) sections of unconstrained reaches in
   three headwater streams in northeastern Oregon. Incision resulted in a
   compositional shift from wetland-obligate plant species to those adapted
   to drier environments. Root biomass was approximately two times greater
   in unincised sections than incised sections and decreased with depth
   more rapidly in incised sections than in unincised sections. Total root
   biomass ranged from 2,153 g m(-2) to 4,759 g m(-2) in unincised sections
   and from 1,107 g m(-2) to 2,215 g m(-2) in incised sections. In
   unincised sections less than 50 percent of the total root biomass was
   found in the top 10 cm, with approximately 20 percent in successive
   10-cm depth increments. In contrast, incised sections had greater than

   percent in the 10 to 20 cm depth, less than 15 percent in the 20 to 30
   cm depth, and less than 10 percent in the 30 to 40 cm depth. This
   distribution of root biomass suggests a positive feedback between
   vegetation and channel incision: as incision progresses, there is a loss
   of hydrologic connectivity, which causes a shift to a drier vegetation
   assemblage and decreased root structure, resulting in a reduced erosive
   resistance capacity in the lower zone of the streambank, thereby
   allowing further incision and widening.}},

Abstract = {{Temperate wetlands are generally net retainers of sulphate (SO4-2).
   However, recent research indicates that some wetlands may export SO4-2
   during drought conditions. In temperate wetlands, the susceptibility to
   drought will depend on wetland-stream and groundwater-surface water
   interactions. Here we present results of summer SO4-2 dynamics in a
   confined and unconfined stream within a temperate swamp.
   At the confined transect, the water table levels dropped greatly (-55
   cm) and groundwater flow patterns reversed in response to summer
   drought. Although high porewater SO4-2 concentrations (36.4 mg l(-1))
   were measured, no downstream export of SO4-2 was observed. A SO4-2 mass
   balance analysis on this stream reach indicated near zero retention. At
   the unconfined transect, water flowed from the stream to the wetland
   throughout most of the summer, maintaining relatively high water table
   levels (-25 cm). Sulphate porewater concentrations were significantly
   lower (9-2 mg l(-1)) than in the confined transect. Downstream discharge
   decreased to zero within this reach during extreme drought conditions,
   resulting in 100\% SO4-2 retention for a three-week period. Upon
   rewetting stream SO4-2 levels increased to 161.7 mg l(-1) resulting in a
   large net export Of SO4-2. This study demonstrates that while water
   table position was an important control on SO4-2 dynamics within the
   wetland, the degree of hydrologic connectivity between the wetland and
   the stream was the main control on episodic SO4-2 release following
   summer drought. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly, biological reserves throughout the world are threatened by
   cumulative alterations in hydrologic connectivity within the greater
   landscape. Hydrologic connectivity is used here in an ecological sense
   to refer to water-mediated transfer of matter, energy, and/or organisms
   within or between elements of the hydrologic cycle. Obvious human
   influences that alter this property include dams, associated flow
   regulation, groundwater extraction, and water diversion, all of which
   can result in a cascade of events in both aquatic and terrestrial
   ecosystems. Even disturbances well outside the boundaries of reserves
   can have profound effects on the biological integrity of these
   ``protected{''} areas. Factors such as nutrient and toxic pollution and
   the spread of normative species are perpetuated by hydrologic
   connectivity, and their effects can be exacerbated by changes in this
   property. Hydrological alterations are now affecting reserves through
   increasingly broad feedback loops, ranging from overdrawn aquifers to
   atmospheric deposition and global climate change. Such alterations are
   often beyond the direct control of managers because they lie outside
   reserve boundaries, and data on hydrologic connection between reserves
   and surrounding landscapes are scant. The subject of water has also been
   typically excluded from the literature pertaining to both theoretical
   and practical aspects of reserve size, isolation, and design. This
   results, in part, from early management strategies developed when the
   landscape matrix outside of reserves was not excessively fragmented, and
   when awareness of hydrologic connectivity was in its infancy.
   The location of a given reserve within a watershed, relative to regional
   aquifers and wind and precipitation patterns, can play a key role in its
   response to human disturbance transmitted through the hydrologic cycle.
   To illustrate this point, I discuss reserves of varying sizes from
   diverse regions throughout the world. Reserves located in middle and
   lower watersheds often suffer direct hydrologic alterations that cause
   severe habitat modification and exacerbate the effects of pollution. In
   contrast, reserves in upper watersheds may have intact physical habitat
   and contain important source populations of some native biota, yet
   hydrologic disturbances in lower watersheds may cause extirpation of
   migratory species, cascading trophic effects, and genetic isolation.
   Worldwide, <7\% of land area is either strictly or partially protected,
   and many reserves are in danger of becoming population ``sinks{''} for
   wildlife if we do not develop a more predictive understanding of how
   they are affected by hydrologic alterations that originate outside of
   their boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrologic connectivity of a catchment determines the efficiency
   with which runoff is moved through the catchment and hence opportunities
   for runoff storage. Potential storages include valley floors and
   alluvial fans. Monitoring results from a small alluvial fan indicate
   that alluvial fans can be significant hydrologic buffers, Between 20\%
   and 100\% of surface runoff delivered to the study fan from a 26-ha
   catchment was slowed and/or stored during the monitored events.
   Interevent differences in buffering response are attributed to
   antecedent moisture conditions. In one event, when catchment conditions
   were very wet, only 20\% of incoming runoff was absorbed by the fan.
   Under dry conditions, smaller proportions of total rainfall were
   delivered to the fan head as surface runoff, of which >60\% was absorbed
   by the fan. Because sediment storages can modify surface runoff
   delivery, because of their distinctive morphologic and sedimentologic
   properties, it is suggested that their distribution through a catchment
   will influence catchment hydrologic connectivity hence runoff and
   sediment delivery through catchments.}},

Abstract = {{Many spatial fields exhibit connectivity features that have an important
   influence on hydrologic behavior. Examples include high-conductivity
   preferred flow paths in aquifers and saturated source areas in drainage
   lines. Connected features can be considered as arbitrarily shaped bands
   or pathways of connected pixels having similar (e.g., high) values.
   Connectivity is a property that is not captured by standard
   geostatistical approaches, which assume that spatial variation occurs in
   the most random possible way that is consistent with the spatial
   correlation, nor is it captured by indicator geostatistics. An
   alternative approach is to use connectivity functions. In this paper we
   apply connectivity functions to 13 observed soil moisture patterns from
   the Tarrawarra catchment and two synthetic aquifer conductivity
   patterns. It is shown that the connectivity functions are able to
   distinguish between connected and disconnected patterns. The importance
   of the connectivity in determining hydrologic behavior is explored using
   rainfall-runoff simulations and groundwater transport simulations. We
   propose the integral connectivity scale as a measure of the presence of
   hydrologic connectivity. Links between the connectivity functions and
   integral connectivity scale and simulated hydrologic behavior are
   demonstrated and explained from a hydrologic process perspective.
   Connectivity functions and the integral connectivity scale provide
   promising means for characterizing features that exist in observed
   spatial fields and that have an important influence on hydrologic
   behavior. Previously, this has not been possible within a statistical
   framework.}},

Title = {{Scales and processes of water and sediment redistribution in drylands:

Abstract = {{Arid lands are characterised by a combination of high temporal
   variability of rainfall and spatial heterogeneity of soil surface
   properties. In response to these environmental conditions, sources and
   sinks of runoff water and sediments tend to be organised in mosaics with
   distinct spatial attributes. These patterns can be identified at several
   scales, each with a predominance of a different set of processes. The
   dynamic relationships between these patterns and processes are an
   essential aspect of spatial connectivity in arid landscapes. During the
   last six years, part of the research at Rambla Honda, a field site in
   Southeast Spain operating under the MEDALUS project, has been concerned
   with this subject. This paper reviews the results obtained up to date at
   the patch and the hillslope scales. The research at the patch scale
   focused on the role of vegetation as a source of spatial heterogeneity
   that affects short-range redistribution patterns of water and sediments.
   The approach has been to identify the dynamic relationships between
   plant clumps and bare ground in sparse vegetation mosaics, using field
   observations, experiments and simulation models. Field observations
   included runoff and sediment yield measurements on bounded plots and
   hillslope sectors, analysis of spatial con-elation structures, as well
   as physiological and architectural properties of plant functional types.
   Experiments included rainfall simulation and runoff exclusion in the
   field, and soil fertility bioassays both in the field and the
   laboratory. A cellular automata model was built to explore the
   interactions between plant clumps and sediment movement. The research at
   the hillslope scale was concerned with the long-range transference of
   water and sediments from rocky upperslopes to their footslope sediment
   fill. The approach was based on an analysis of the available information
   about spatial patterns of soil moisture and discharge of runoff and
   sediments from plots and stream gauges in a first order catchment.
   Results show that, at the patch scale, in sparse vegetation, a range of
   positive feedback mechanisms lead to nucleation, or to the increase of
   spatial heterogeneity, by concentrating resources in the soil beneath
   plant clumps at the expense of the neighbouring bare ground. This
   spatial heterogeneity arises dynamically through the interaction between
   plant growth and hillslope fluxes of water and sediments. Within
   specific boundary conditions, this interaction is `tuned' towards the
   formation of mosaics of bare and vegetated patches with patterns that
   minimise redistribution lengths of water and sediments. The boundary
   conditions that affect the `tuning' process include factors that
   determine the potential distance and transport capacity of runoff, such
   as temporal variability of rainfall, slope angle, slope length, among
   others, and plant specific factors that affect the efficiency of plant
   clumps in trapping the resources that are redistributed on the
   hillslope. At the hillslope scale, the transference of sediment and
   water between hillslope elements requires very specific within-event
   temporal distributions of rainfall that allow for the widespread
   formation of a saturated layer at shallow depth and overland flow to
   reach first order channels. During most rainfall events these conditions
   are not met and, therefore, in most seasons, mean values of soil
   moisture do not increase downhill, and rather reflect variation in local
   soil properties than the effects of lateral redistribution processes.
   As a consequence, it may be expected that small changes of the frequency
   distribution of rainfall characteristics, in terms of within-storm
   temporal distribution of intensities, could lead to significant changes
   in soil moisture patterns and hydrologic connectivity between hillslope
   elements. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have found that ``pristine{''} peatlands have high pear

   the Northern Hemisphere, this finding has potentially far ranging
   implications for the global mercury cycle, particularly in areas

Abstract = {{Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and dissolved organic carbon
